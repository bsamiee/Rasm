# [RASM_BIM_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `Rasm.Bim` — the host-neutral AEC-DOMAIN BIM object model and IFC/glTF/STEP exchange. The `Model`, `Semantics`, `Planning`, `Exchange`, and `Review` sub-domains, each composing the one `BimModel` and lowering onto the one `BimFault` band.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, lowercase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

Every sub-domain composes the one `BimModel` the `Exchange` import rail produces rather than a parallel model surface, lowers rejection onto the `Model/Faults` `BimFault` band, and consumes the `Model/Query` `ElementPredicate` algebra and the `Semantics/Classification` axis as settled vocabulary.

- [^1] App-root RhinoDoc import projected to host-neutral mesh + GlobalId; Rhino owns the Rhino-side production + projection adapter, Bim owns the wire payload — the two reader engines (Rhino FileIO vs the managed PlyReader/ThreeMfReader/StepReader + SharpGLTF/geometry3Sharp arms) can disagree on the same OBJ/STL/PLY/3MF/glTF/STEP bytes, so the app path declares which reader is authoritative

The `[CONTENT_KEY]` seam rows above are one canonical idiom, not per-page schemes: every page that joins the federation, solver, cache, or diff lane derives a typed `UInt128` key pair through `XxHash128.HashToUInt128` and joins the `csharp:Rasm.Compute/Runtime/codecs` `CONTENT_ADDRESSING` `InterchangeIdentity`, never a second identity scheme.

[CONTENT_KEY_IDIOM]:
- `Model/structural` derives `(GeometryKey, PropertyKey)` — the analytical member's geometry plus its section/material property hash, the solver join surface.
- `Model/systems` derives `(GeometryKey, TopologyKey)` — the distribution element's geometry plus its port-connectivity topology hash, the trace memoization key.
- `Planning/schedule` derives `(GeometryKey, ScheduleKey)` — the element geometry plus its 4D task-time hash, the schedule catalog read.
- `Planning/cost` derives `(QuantityKey, ResourceKey)` — the quantity-set hash plus the resource-rate hash, the cost-rollup join.
- `Review/diff` derives `(ContentKey, PlacementKey)` — the element fingerprint plus its placement hash, the federation dedup and three-way merge anchor.
- `Exchange/tessellation`, `Exchange/wire`, and `Exchange/import` derive the artifact `ContentKey` through the same `InterchangeIdentity.Key` so the tessellation cache, the wire snapshot, and the reimport delta all address one content space.

A second identity scheme, a per-page hash function, or a `Guid`-keyed federation join is the named cross-folder drift defect: a page deriving a new content key inherits this idiom from the map, mints the typed `UInt128` pair through `XxHash128.HashToUInt128`, and joins the one `InterchangeIdentity` owner.

[HOST_BOUNDARY_EDGE]: the `Exchange/import ← csharp:Rasm.Rhino/Exchange` row is a single-sided HOST-BOUNDARY edge, not an interior dependency — `Rasm.Rhino/Exchange` is strata-locked, every format dispatching through RhinoCommon `Rhino.FileIO.*`/`RhinoDoc` with zero host-neutral parts, so it references only the kernel `Rasm` and is composed exclusively at the app root. `Rasm.Bim` never names `Rasm.Rhino`; the edge resolves only where the app root binds the live Rhino host, projecting a `RhinoDoc` import to a host-neutral mesh plus `GlobalId` the `Exchange/import` fold admits as a wire payload. Bim owns the wire payload; Rhino owns the Rhino-side production and the projection adapter. Because the two reader engines — Rhino FileIO and the managed `PlyReader`/`ThreeMfReader`/`StepReader` plus the SharpGLTF/`geometry3Sharp` arms — can decode the same OBJ/STL/PLY/3MF/glTF/STEP bytes to divergent meshes, the app root declares per path which reader is authoritative; the two coexist (Rhino-native capture and host-neutral managed ingest) and neither is gutted to feed the other.
