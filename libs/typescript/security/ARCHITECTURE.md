# [TS_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `security` — the wave-1 identity-and-custody package. Three sub-domains (`crypt`, `authn`, `access`) meet through one crypto authority, one session vocabulary, and one tenancy contract; every stateful obligation is a port Tag the data wave satisfies at app composition, so the folder imports only core.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, camelCase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

## [02]-[SEAMS]

```text seams

crypt/secret    →  typescript:iac/kube        # [BOUNDARY]: doppler-run leased env injection at the workload entrypoint
```

## [03]-[ORGANIZATION]

`crypt/sign` is the one crypto authority — every digest, signature, token, and envelope in the folder mints there; `crypt/verify` is its inbound mirror, one dialect table over held octets so no route hand-rolls signature checks; `crypt/secret` scopes the Doppler client to exactly the leased surfaces the folder admits. `authn/session` is the identity spine the other ceremonies feed: `credential` funnels three second-factor surfaces through one mint-and-resolve idiom, `oauth` models issuers as vocabulary rows, and `webauthn` splits the passkey ceremony by runtime subpath so the browser bundle never carries the RP verifier. `access` turns verified identity into decisions: `claim` evaluates entitlements once per request, `tenant` states the tenancy contract the data wave enforces as row-level security.

## [04]-[BOUNDARIES]

- The folder persists nothing: `SessionStore`, `IdentityJournal`, `ClaimStore`, and `RelationStore` are port Tags; the data wave builds the satisfying Layers and the app root binds them.
- Content-identity digesting is core's; this folder owns secret derivation and authenticated crypto only.
- Cookie framing and CSRF are egress projections declared here and consumed by the runtime browser session plane; no browser API is touched here.
- Tenancy is declared here and enforced in the data wave; the folder never opens a database transaction.
