# [RASM_BIM_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `Rasm.Bim` — the host-neutral AEC-DOMAIN BIM/IFC owner and the IFC arm of the `Rasm.Element` seam, depending UP on `{Rasm, Rasm.Element}` and projecting GeometryGym into the canonical `ElementGraph` rather than re-storing a parallel element record. The `Model`, `Semantics`, `Planning`, `Exchange`, `Energy`, `Review`, and `Projection` sub-domains, each lowering onto the one `BimFault` band; the `Projection` sub-domain hosts the one `SemanticProjector : IElementProjection` (GeometryGym `DatabaseIfc` → seam `GraphDelta` ingress; the Bim-internal `Emit` IFC re-author) and the `IfcLegality : IGraphConstraint` IFC-semantic legality. The retired `BimElement`/`BimModel` element record and the stringly `PropertyBinding`/`QuantityBinding` triples are GONE — the consumer-facing element is the seam `Bake(objectNode)` fold over the `ElementGraph`. Bim stays the SOLE GeometryGym/IFC owner and references no AEC peer; alignment with `Rasm.Materials`/`Rasm.Fabrication` travels through the shared seam graph and the content-keyed wire, never sibling coupling.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, lowercase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

Every sub-domain projects onto or reads the one seam `ElementGraph` (the `Projection/Semantic` `SemanticProjector` lowers GeometryGym into it; the seam `Bake(objectNode)` fold derives the consumer element) rather than a parallel `BimModel` surface, lowers rejection onto the `Model/Faults` `BimFault` band, and consumes the `Model/Query` `ElementPredicate` algebra and the `Semantics/Classification` axis as settled vocabulary.

```
- [^1] App-root RhinoDoc import projected to host-neutral mesh + GlobalId; Rhino owns the Rhino-side production + projection adapter, Bim owns the wire payload — the two reader engines (Rhino FileIO vs the managed PlyReader/ThreeMfReader/StepReader + SharpGLTF/geometry3Sharp arms) can disagree on the same OBJ/STL/PLY/3MF/glTF/STEP bytes, so the app path declares which reader is authoritative

The `[CONTENT_KEY]` seam rows above are one canonical idiom, not per-page schemes: every page that joins the federation, solver, cache, or diff lane derives a typed `UInt128` key through the ONE kernel seed-zero hasher — `ContentHash.Of` over the seam `Rasm.Element/Projection/address#CANONICAL_WRITER` `CanonicalWriter` fold — and the `csharp:Rasm.Compute/Runtime/codecs` `CONTENT_ADDRESSING` lane joins the same content space at the seam, never a second identity scheme and never a downward `InterchangeIdentity` reference from Bim.

[CONTENT_KEY_IDIOM]:
- `Model/structural` carries NO parallel model key — the analytical member resolves one-hop by its `Representations.Axis` content key; restraint/load payloads ride the neutral `Generic` edges.
- `Model/systems` derives `(MembershipKey, TopologyKey)` — the ordered member-id hash plus the sorted flow-edge topology hash, the trace memoization key.
- `Planning/schedule` derives `(GeometryKey, ScheduleKey)` — the element geometry plus its 4D task-time hash, the schedule catalog read.
- `Planning/cost` derives `(QuantityKey, ResourceKey)` — the quantity-set hash plus the per-value resource-rate hash, the cost-rollup join.
- `Review/diff` derives `(ContentKey, PlacementKey)` — the element fingerprint plus its placement hash, the federation dedup and three-way merge anchor.
- `Exchange/tessellation`, `Exchange/export`, `Exchange/import`, and `Energy/exchange` mint the artifact `ContentKey` through the same kernel `ContentHash` + `CanonicalWriter` fold, and `Exchange/wire` stamps the serialization-independent seam `ContentAddress.OfGraph` (the `Energy/exchange` `EnergyArtifact.Graph` pedigree reuses it) — so the tessellation cache, the emitted artifact, the reimport delta, the energy-model document, and the wire identity all address one content space.

A second identity scheme, a per-page hash function, or a `Guid`-keyed federation join is the named cross-folder drift defect: a page deriving a new content key inherits this idiom from the map and mints through the one kernel seed-zero `XxHash128` owner.

[HOST_BOUNDARY_EDGE]: the `Exchange/import ← csharp:Rasm.Rhino/Exchange` row is a single-sided HOST-BOUNDARY edge, not an interior dependency — `Rasm.Rhino/Exchange` is strata-locked, every format dispatching through RhinoCommon `Rhino.FileIO.*`/`RhinoDoc` with zero host-neutral parts, so it references only the kernel `Rasm` and is composed exclusively at the app root. `Rasm.Bim` never names `Rasm.Rhino`; the edge resolves only where the app root binds the live Rhino host, projecting a `RhinoDoc` import to a host-neutral mesh plus `GlobalId` the `Exchange/import` fold admits as a wire payload. Bim owns the wire payload; Rhino owns the Rhino-side production and the projection adapter. Because the two reader engines — Rhino FileIO and the managed `PlyReader`/`ThreeMfReader`/`StepReader` plus the SharpGLTF/`geometry3Sharp` arms — can decode the same OBJ/STL/PLY/3MF/glTF/STEP bytes to divergent meshes, the app root declares per path which reader is authoritative; the two coexist (Rhino-native capture and host-neutral managed ingest) and neither is gutted to feed the other.
