# [TYPESCRIPT_DERIVATION]

This page is the derivation law: every type, vocabulary, and secondary surface computes from one anchor, and a hand-written parallel is a second, unverified source of truth. The type plane is the value plane's derived shadow — one declaration anchors each correspondence, `typeof`, `keyof typeof`, indexed access, mapped generation, template literals, and conditional decomposition compute everything downstream, and inference is solved once at the owner so no consumer ever re-states what the anchor already carries. Everything around the algebra is shed by kind: the annotation and emit seam an exported anchor rides is `language.md`'s, collection and scalar selection is `values.md`'s, Schema owners and their derived surfaces are `shapes.md`'s, and overload sets, `Match` terminals, and `Function.dual` operators are `surfaces-and-dispatch.md`'s.

## [01]-[ANCHOR_ALGEBRA]

[ANCHOR_ALGEBRA]:
- Anchor law: one declaration anchors each correspondence — a value anchor where runtime rows, iteration, or order exist (the `as const satisfies` table, the `as const` key tuple), a type anchor where the correspondence is purely type-plane, a `const` type parameter where the caller supplies the shape, a state parameter where the fact is protocol position
- Direction law: types derive from values, and secondary types derive from primary types — discriminants through `keyof typeof`, projections through indexed access, families through mapped and template-literal generation, channels through extractors; no hand parallel in either direction
- Placement law: `satisfies` checks an anchor declaration, an annotation states a public operation surface, and `as` is kernel material — each declaration fixes its form once, and a widening annotation on an anchor destroys every literal downstream
- Pre-solve law: inference is the owner's obligation — `const` type parameters, `NoInfer` check-only positions, and instantiation expressions fix literals at the declaration; a consumer writing a type argument, an `as const`, or a re-assertion marks the owner's signature as the defect
- Posture law: distribution and variance are declared decisions — a naked conditional parameter maps a union member-wise, `[T] extends [U]` asks one question of the whole, and `in`/`out` annotations make variance checked intent
- Fence law: `HKT.TypeLambda` quantifies over containers only and is proven by plural instances; a phantom state parameter carries compile-time protocol facts only and is witnessed or it enforces nothing

Treat the type level as computation over anchors, never as a place to author facts. Replace a hand union, a parallel constant, a mirrored interface, a re-asserted literal, or an assertion-repaired spread the moment an anchor can derive it.

## [02]-[CANONICAL_CHOOSER]

Each table routes a correspondence to the form that owns it, and every `[USE]` names the spelling it deletes. Each group routes to its `[03]` contract for the rule a row cannot state.

## [03]-[DERIVATION_CONTRACTS]

Each contract fixes the placement rule its chooser rows cannot state. Snippets compose settled surfaces as supporting material; the spotlight is the derivation mechanism itself, and each contract closes on the boundary that hands the derived surface to its owning page.

[VOCABULARY_TABLE_SITE]:
- Use when: a bounded keyed domain carries behavior rows and its secondary surfaces — discriminant, projections, wire literal, returns — must stay provably consistent with it.
- Accept: the table as the default anchor with open string keys; the key tuple joining the owner the moment order or a non-empty spread is load-bearing, the table then checked against `Record<(typeof kinds)[number], Row>` so the key set closes in both directions — a missing row is a missing property, an extra row is an excess-property error; `keyof typeof` discriminants; indexed row, row-union, and axis projections; a conditional return derived as indexed access over the table keyed by the generic literal parameter.
- Reject: a hand union or parallel constant beside the table; an open `Record<string, Row>` contract kept after the tuple exists — a one-directional check that admits drift; an `extends ?` conditional return — the checker cannot prove its body, and the cast it demands marks dispatch that belongs to the overload owner; table keys restated inside a wire literal.
- Law: the tuple spread holds `Schema.Literal`'s non-empty overload and preserves the exact literal tuple; spreading derived keys lands in the widened `ReadonlyArray` overload and demotes the schema to `SchemaClass<Kind>` — non-emptiness and order are tuple facts stated once at the anchor, never assertion repairs at the seam.
- Boundary: the Schema owner that admits the wire value, and the class families vocabularies embed into, are `shapes.md`'s; dispatch composed over row lookups is `surfaces-and-dispatch.md`'s.

```ts conceptual
import { Schema } from "effect"

export const tiers = ["tight", "steady", "loose"] as const   // key anchor: a non-empty tuple by construction; order and spread evidence live here

export const Tier = {                                        // row table checked against the anchor: a missing or extra row is a compile error
  tight: { ceiling: 4, weight: 3, wire: 429 },
  steady: { ceiling: 16, weight: 2, wire: 425 },
  loose: { ceiling: 64, weight: 1, wire: 503 },
} as const satisfies Record<(typeof tiers)[number], { readonly ceiling: number; readonly weight: number; readonly wire: number }>

export declare namespace Tier {
  export type Kind = keyof typeof Tier                       // discriminant derives; a hand union is a second, unverified source of truth
  export type Row = (typeof Tier)[Kind]
  export type Ceiling = Row["ceiling"]                       // axis projection: 4 | 16 | 64 computed, never listed
}

export const TierWire = Schema.Literal(...tiers)             // the tuple spread holds the non-empty overload: Literal<["tight","steady","loose"]> — spreading derived keys demotes to SchemaClass<Kind>

export const ceiling = <K extends Tier.Kind>(kind: K): (typeof Tier)[K]["ceiling"] => Tier[kind].ceiling // conditional return by indexed access: the checker proves the body

export const cap = ceiling("tight")                          // : 4 — the row's literal, never the axis union
```

[GENERATED_SURFACE_SITE]:
- Use when: a member family corresponds to an anchor generatively — renamed handler names, capability matrices, filtered projections — so the family's size tracks the anchor's, never a hand count.
- Accept: mapped types with `as` key remapping and the intrinsic case operators `Capitalize`, `Uncapitalize`, `Uppercase`, `Lowercase`; template-literal cross products multiplying union anchors; row-predicate filtering by remapping the excluded key to `never`; `Extract` and `Exclude` over template patterns for subsets; a policy value `satisfies`-checked against the generated union, closing the loop — a new anchor row breaks the governed value loudly at compile time.
- Reject: sibling interfaces restating a family member by member; enumerated string constants a template cross product derives; a parallel filtered table beside its anchor; a generated family over members that merely rhyme — generation encodes a real correspondence, never a coincidence of spelling.
- Law: the mapped parameter correlates name and payload — `(typeof Anchor)[K]` keeps each generated member row-precise where a hand-written family blurs every payload to the union.
- Law: generation is type-plane — a key the runtime must compute crosses at a value, because runtime case conversion widens to `string` and cannot index a generated record; a family the runtime addresses by key anchors as table rows instead.
- Boundary: domain shape variants, partial views, and wire projections derive on the Schema owner in `shapes.md`; these forms own type-seam families only.

```ts conceptual
import type { Effect } from "effect"

export const verbs = ["emit", "drain"] as const

export const Signal = {
  open: { grade: "state", retain: true },
  frame: { grade: "burst", retain: false },
  close: { grade: "state", retain: true },
} as const satisfies Record<string, { readonly grade: "state" | "burst"; readonly retain: boolean }>

export declare namespace Signal {
  export type Kind = keyof typeof Signal
  export type Wake = { readonly [K in Kind as `on${Capitalize<K>}`]: (row: (typeof Signal)[K]) => Effect.Effect<void> } // remapped family: K correlates each generated name to its row-precise payload
  export type Retained = { readonly [K in Kind as (typeof Signal)[K]["retain"] extends true ? K : never]: (typeof Signal)[K] } // filtering is remap-to-never on the row's own column
  export type Grant = `${Kind}:${(typeof verbs)[number]}`    // cross product: |Kind| x |verbs| literals from two anchors, zero listed
  export type Drain = Extract<Grant, `${string}:drain`>      // subset by template pattern, never a re-listed union
}

export const quota = {                                       // the generated union governs the value: a new Signal row breaks this table loudly
  "open:emit": 8,
  "open:drain": 2,
  "frame:emit": 64,
  "frame:drain": 16,
  "close:emit": 8,
  "close:drain": 2,
} as const satisfies Record<Signal.Grant, number>
```

[INFERENCE_PRESOLVE_SITE]:
- Use when: an owner accepts literal-bearing arguments whose precision downstream types consume — plans, routes, step tuples, keyed selections.
- Accept: a `const` type parameter so caller literals and tuples arrive narrow with zero call-site ceremony; `NoInfer` on every position that checks against another position's inference instead of driving it; an instantiation expression pre-solving a package generic once at the owner under a semantic name; derived return fields projecting the inferred literal shape.
- Reject: caller `as const` discipline — unenforceable and lost at the first refactor; a mirror type parameter added to repair inference order; a wrapper arrow restating a whole signature to pin one type argument — the instantiation expression pins it with no body; a call site writing a type argument the owner's signature should have fixed.
- Law: one position drives inference and every other position checks — `NoInfer` moves the error to the wrong argument instead of silently widening the inference the right argument produced.
- Law: pre-solving is not renaming — the instantiation expression changes the type surface by monomorphizing the generic to the domain shape, and the binding carries the domain role's semantic name; a binding that changes neither type nor name is the deleted hop.
- Boundary: data-first/data-last pairing on a pre-solved operator is `surfaces-and-dispatch.md`'s.

```ts conceptual
import { Array } from "effect"

export const Lane = { bulk: 64, live: 8 } as const

export declare namespace Lane {
  export type Kind = keyof typeof Lane
  export type Step = { readonly lane: Kind; readonly take: number }
}

export const plan = <const Steps extends ReadonlyArray<Lane.Step>>( // const parameter: caller literals arrive narrow with zero as const at any call site
  steps: Steps,
  fuse: NoInfer<Steps[number]["lane"]>,                      // check-only position: steps alone drives inference; fuse validates against the plan's own lanes
): { readonly steps: Steps; readonly fuse: Steps[number]["lane"] } => ({ steps, fuse })

export const nextStep = Array.head<Lane.Step>                // instantiation expression: the package generic pre-solved once, under a semantic name

export const run = plan([{ lane: "live", take: 2 }, { lane: "bulk", take: 5 }], "live")

export type Fuse = typeof run.fuse                           // "live" | "bulk" — the owner solved inference; consumers never re-instantiate or re-assert
```

[CONDITIONAL_DECOMPOSITION_SITE]:
- Use when: a type computes from another type's structure — channel extraction, literal-pattern parsing, whole-shape questions over unions.
- Accept: shipped extractors first — `Effect.Effect.Success`, `Effect.Effect.Error`, `Effect.Effect.Context`, `Schema.Schema.Type`, `Schema.Schema.Encoded`, `Context.Tag.Service`, `Layer.Layer.Success` — a hand `infer` over a package carrier re-derives what the package already exports; one bracketed multi-clause conditional for local carriers, every channel extracted in a single match with `infer ... extends` constraints inline; naked-parameter distribution only as the deliberate member-wise map; explicit `in`/`out` on public generic carriers.
- Reject: chained single-`infer` conditionals where one clause extracts every channel; a naked conditional that must answer once for the whole — `boolean` splits to `true | false` and `never` distributes to nothing, so an undeclared posture is a latent bug, not a style choice; variance left to inference on a public carrier when the annotation makes intent compiler-checked.
- Law: `infer M extends Realm` narrows inside the clause — the constraint participates in the match itself, and a failed constraint selects the false branch; a post-filter conditional after an unconstrained `infer` is the rejected two-step spelling.
- Law: recursion is budgeted — a recursive conditional decomposes bounded structural shapes in tail position only; type-level parsing or arithmetic over domain data re-derives what the value level owns, and the repair is one value computation whose result the type level derives from the anchor.
- Boundary: exhaustive dispatch over an extracted union is `surfaces-and-dispatch.md`'s.

```ts conceptual
import type { Effect } from "effect"

export type Realm = "doc" | "layer"                          // type anchor: no runtime row exists, so the union itself anchors the correspondence
export type Verb = "pull" | "push"

export interface Feed<in Cmd, out Row> {                     // declared variance is checked intent: a wrong in/out is a compile error
  readonly push: (cmd: Cmd) => Effect.Effect<void, RangeError>
  readonly tail: Effect.Effect<Row>
}

export type Parse<R> = R extends `${infer M extends Realm}/${infer V extends Verb}` // multi-clause infer: every channel extracts in one conditional, constraints inside the match
  ? { readonly realm: M; readonly verb: V }
  : never

export type Split = Parse<"doc/pull" | "layer/push">         // naked parameter distributes: a union maps per member, two records out

export type Facet<H> = [H] extends [(cmd: infer C) => Effect.Effect<infer _A, infer E>] // bracketed posture: one answer over the whole shape, never a per-member split
  ? { readonly cmd: C; readonly fault: E }
  : never

export type Probe = Facet<Feed<`${Realm}/${Verb}`, number>["push"]> // { cmd: "doc/pull" | "doc/push" | "layer/pull" | "layer/push"; fault: RangeError }
```

[CONTAINER_KIND_SITE]:
- Use when: one combinator must serve many containers — the same enrichment over `Option`, `ReadonlyArray`, and an own container, written once.
- Accept: an own `HKT.TypeLambda` implementor per own container, whose single `readonly type` line states how the container consumes `this["Target"]`; combinator signatures over `HKT.Kind<F, In, Out2, Out1, Target>` constrained by the `@effect/typeclass` vocabulary — `Covariant` and its siblings — with `In`, `Out2`, and `Out1` threading ambient channels and `Target` as the mapped slot; shipped instances from `@effect/typeclass/data/Option` and `@effect/typeclass/data/Array`; one own instance per own container, its dual `map` paired with the `covariant.imap` derivation.
- Reject: an HKT combinator with one instance — an ordinary generic wearing a lambda; domain variation carried on `F` — vocabulary rows and tagged families own domain axes, the lambda owns containers only; a local functor-shaped interface shadowing the typeclass vocabulary; container abstraction no call site swaps.
- Law: the fence is plural instantiation — the lambda earns existence when combinator call sites apply distinct instances; when every call site names one container, the combinator collapses into that container's module and the lambda dies.
- Boundary: which container a domain value rides, and the instance merge algebra over `struct` and `tuple` composition, are `values.md`'s.

```ts conceptual
import * as covariant from "@effect/typeclass/Covariant"
import * as ArrayTc from "@effect/typeclass/data/Array"
import * as OptionTc from "@effect/typeclass/data/Option"
import { Function, type HKT, Option } from "effect"

export interface Ranked<out A> {                             // an own container earns an own lambda; the variance annotation travels with it
  readonly rank: number
  readonly value: A
}

export interface RankedTypeLambda extends HKT.TypeLambda {
  readonly type: Ranked<this["Target"]>                      // the one line a lambda owns: how the container consumes its Target
}

const _map = Function.dual<
  <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (self: Ranked<A>) => Ranked<B>,
  <A, B>(self: Ranked<A>, f: (a: A) => B) => Ranked<B>
>(2, (self, f) => ({ rank: self.rank, value: f(self.value) }))

export const RankedCovariant: covariant.Covariant<RankedTypeLambda> = { map: _map, imap: covariant.imap<RankedTypeLambda>(_map) }

export const brace = <F extends HKT.TypeLambda>(F: covariant.Covariant<F>) => // one combinator, every container: the instance is the only per-container cost
  <R, O, E>(self: HKT.Kind<F, R, O, E, number>): HKT.Kind<F, R, O, E, { readonly value: number; readonly even: boolean }> =>
    F.map(self, (value) => ({ value, even: value % 2 === 0 }))

export const braced = brace(OptionTc.Covariant)(Option.some(3))    // Option.Option<{ value: number; even: boolean }>
export const rows = brace(ArrayTc.Covariant)([1, 2, 3])            // ReadonlyArray<{ value: number; even: boolean }>
export const ranked = brace(RankedCovariant)({ rank: 1, value: 3 }) // Ranked<{ value: number; even: boolean }>
```

[TYPESTATE_SITE]:
- Use when: the legality of a call depends on protocol position — a terminal operation forbidden until every slot is set, a transition forbidden after it fires — and the runtime holds no state that could check it.
- Accept: one state parameter accumulating filled keys through `Exclude`-constrained transitions, so a refill fails at the key constraint; the terminal operation demanding completion structurally — its parameter typed at the full record, never a conditional return; `Record.singleton` composing the accumulated record — a generic computed key in an object literal widens to a string index, so the package construction carries what the checker cannot type; `@ts-expect-error` proof tokens pinning each forbidden call as rejected.
- Reject: a phantom parameter carrying ordinary domain data — a value the program reads at runtime is a field on its owner, never a type argument; an unreferenced state parameter — an unused type parameter does not participate in assignability, so every instantiation unifies and the protocol it claims is unenforced; a runtime flag re-checking what the state parameter proves; a conditional-return terminal whose implementation needs the cast.
- Law: the witness law — a protocol parameter is witnessed structurally in a real position or through a `Types.Invariant` variance slot; unwitnessed state erases from comparison and enforces nothing.
- Law: the subtraction law — each transition subtracts its key from the open set and intersects it into the filled record, so the protocol is order-free, refills are compile errors, and completion is exactly the spent key set.
- Boundary: a builder whose product is a domain shape terminates at the Schema owner in `shapes.md`; runtime acquire/release ordering is `rails-and-effects.md` material.

```ts conceptual
import { Record } from "effect"

type Slots = { readonly route: string; readonly limit: number; readonly lane: "bulk" | "live" }

export interface Draft<Filled extends Partial<Slots>> {      // Filled is witnessed structurally by state; an unreferenced parameter would enforce nothing
  readonly state: Filled
  readonly slot: <K extends Exclude<keyof Slots, keyof Filled>>(key: K, value: Slots[K]) => Draft<Filled & Record<K, Slots[K]>>
}

export const draft = <Filled extends Partial<Slots>>(state: Filled): Draft<Filled> => ({
  state,
  slot: (key, value) => draft({ ...state, ...Record.singleton(key, value) }), // the package construction carries the generic single-key record the checker cannot type
})

export const seal = (complete: Draft<Slots>): Slots => complete.state // completion is demanded by the parameter type, never by a conditional return needing a cast

const staged = draft({}).slot("route", "<value-a>").slot("limit", 8)

// @ts-expect-error the protocol forbids refilling a slot
export const twice = staged.slot("route", "<value-b>")

// @ts-expect-error seal demands every slot; "lane" is missing
export const early = seal(staged)

export const sealed = seal(staged.slot("lane", "live"))      // : Slots — the order-free protocol closes only when the key set is spent
```

## [04]-[ABSTRACTION_COLLAPSE_TESTS]

Use these tests before keeping a form the derivation layer already owns.

[PARALLEL_RESTATEMENT]:
- Smell: a hand union tracks a table's keys, an interface mirrors a derivable type, or a second constant restates rows another declaration carries.
- Collapse: derive — `keyof typeof`, indexed access, mapped generation, template cross product, or the shipped extractor.
- Done when: every secondary surface computes from its anchor, and deleting the parallel changes no meaning anywhere.

[CALL_SITE_RESIDUE]:
- Smell: consumers write `as const`, type arguments, or literal re-assertions, or re-derive a union the owner already carries.
- Collapse: `const` type parameters, `NoInfer` check-only positions, and instantiation expressions at the owner.
- Done when: call sites carry values only, and the owner's signature is the only place inference is described.

[TYPE_PLANE_OVERREACH]:
- Smell: type-level parsing or arithmetic re-derives a value fact, a recursive conditional hits depth pressure, or a conditional return needs a cast to implement.
- Collapse: compute at the value level and derive the type from the anchor; move provable returns to indexed access and dispatch to the overload owner.
- Done when: every conditional body is checker-proven, and no directive or cast spans a derivation.

[UNWITNESSED_ABSTRACTION]:
- Smell: an HKT combinator every call site applies to one container, or a state parameter that is unused or carries domain data.
- Collapse: the ordinary generic or the container's own module; a structural or `Types.Invariant` witness, or a field on the owning shape.
- Done when: every lambda has plural instances at real call sites, and every state parameter is witnessed and protocol-only.
