# [<pkg-token>_<page-token>]

<page-telos-lead-one-paragraph: the owner's charter in owning voice — the capability it owns, the piece it plays in the unit's system, and the boundary it holds; never the doc-set, realization status, or a sibling recap.>

<page-composition-lead-one-paragraph: the settled facts a rebuild composes without re-derivation — reused axes and their owning pages, seam obligations and frozen wire names, admission and receipt rails, modality and policy rows the page binds; present only when the page carries them, never process narration or restated higher law.>

## [03]-[SHAPE_FOLD]

- Owner: `ShapeFold` mints the one shape-op entry and owns op dispatch
- Cases: `ShapeOp` cases Refine, Merge, and Split
- Entry: `apply` discriminates single, batch, and stream by input shape
- Receipt: `ShapeReceipt.contribute` folds evidence into the run
- Packages: `shape-core` for the refinement kernel
- Growth: a new op is one `ShapeOp` case plus one dispatch arm
- Boundary: this owner refuses wire decode, deferred to the codec seam

```python signature
class ShapeFold:
    def apply(self, op: ShapeOp) -> Result[ShapeReceipt, ShapeFault]: ...
```
