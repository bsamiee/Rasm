# [PY_COMPUTE_CODEGEN]

The typed-stub projector that decodes the C# graduation-evidence bundle and synthesizes `msgspec.Struct` stubs through the stdlib `ast` builder. `StubCodegen` consumes the offline-seam bundle the C# graduation evidence seals, decodes it once polymorphically over the wire format the seam chose, and folds each owner descriptor into Python type-stub source — so downstream compute composes against the C# owner row by import rather than by re-typing it. The descriptor is a wire-decoded discriminated union: `FieldDescriptor` is the `tag_field`-discriminated `Struct` family whose scalar case carries a `FieldScalar` literal and whose composite cases (`array`/`nested`/`mapping`/`optional`/`union`) carry their typed sub-descriptors, so the shape kind lives in the case the discriminant selects rather than in parallel `element`/`nested` optionals racing the kind; the decoder targets the closed `FieldNode` leaf union, never the open base, so `kind` selects exactly one case. The descriptor descent is ONE recursion-schema `_fold(node, alg)` parameterized by a `FieldAlgebra[T]` output interpreter — the catamorphism is written once and run by three interpreters: `_NODE` producing the `ast.expr` annotation, `_TYPES` collecting the scalar runtime types, and `_REFS` collecting the `nested` owner-name edges. The divergence-free invariant is a literal identity rather than a parallel claim: the `defstruct` field type IS `ast.unparse(_fold(field, _NODE))`, the same `ast.expr` the stub source renders, so the stub annotation and the schema field type cannot diverge on shape. A separate `_HINT` interpreter that re-evaluated `|`/subscription at fold time is the deleted form — it raised `TypeError` on `optional`/`union` over a `nested` owner-name string (`str | None` is unsupported), whereas the `ast.BinOp(ast.BitOr())` node never evaluates the operator and the forward ref stays a name `defstruct(namespace=)` binds at class creation. The eight wire primitives live in the one `_SCALAR` table the annotation and the type-collection interpreters read, and there is no second per-kind annotation method, parallel scalar table, or hand-written dependency walk. No annotation is rendered to a string and re-parsed through `ast.parse`: every node is synthesized, the scalar leaf rendering to its dotted module+qualname `ast` node so `decimal.Decimal` and `ContentKey` resolve without a hand-keyed `ast` row, and a data-driven import preamble (synthesized off the same `_TYPES` fold over the `_SCALAR`/`_BARE` policy) prepends `from msgspec import Struct` plus exactly the scalar imports the annotations name — so the emitted stub is importable, not a body of unresolved bases and scalar names. `emit` is polymorphic over the inbound wire format (`json`/`msgpack`, one `msgspec` codec) AND the outbound target (`stub` source, `schema` `$defs`, or `both`), and runs the decode-fold-render under one OTel span weaving `msgspec`, `beartype`, OTel, and the runtime `Signals` receipt fold into a single rail. The `RawBundle` `beartype.vale.Is` refinement is checked by `@beartype(conf=FAULT_CONF)` on the inner `_decode` thunk the runtime `boundary` wraps — so a contract breach folds onto the fault rail through the `CLASSIFY` `api` row rather than escaping the owner — and the `emitted` receipt streams through the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` egress aspect wearing the `_emit` builder inside the same `boundary` thunk, the canonical decorator rail `observability/receipts#RECEIPT` declares and the sibling `graduation/handoff.md#GRADUATION`/`experiments/inference.md#BAYESIAN`/`experiments/model.md#ASSET` owners hold, never an inline `Signals.emit` double-emit threaded through the body and never an inline `structlog` line. The bundle is consumed at the boundary and never re-minted: this owner reads the evidence shape the C# graduation evidence already carries, emits type stubs and JSON Schema only, never runtime behavior, and imports nothing from a C# interior.

## [01]-[INDEX]

- [01]-[STUB_CODEGEN]: the wire-decoded `FieldNode` union, the one `_fold` recursion schema run under three `FieldAlgebra` interpreters (`_NODE` annotation nodes whose `ast.unparse` IS both the stub source and the `defstruct` field type, `_TYPES` scalar-type collection feeding the import preamble and the `defstruct` namespace seed, `_REFS` nested-edge collection for the dependency-ordered `defstruct` build), the data-driven import preamble, the format-and-target-polymorphic `emit` rail folding the contract fence onto the `boundary`, and the `GeneratedModule` receipt streamed through the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` egress aspect over the `_emit` builder.

## [02]-[STUB_CODEGEN]

- Owner: `StubCodegen` — the one projector consuming the C# graduation-evidence bundle and emitting typed Python stubs plus their JSON Schema; it reads `EvidenceBundle`, `OwnerDescriptor`, and the `FieldNode` leaf union (the shape the C# graduation evidence carries) and folds each descriptor into an `ast.ClassDef` through the stdlib `ast` builder and into a `$defs` component through `msgspec.json.schema_components`. `FieldScalar` is the scalar-kind `StrEnum` whose runtime type lives in the `_SCALAR` data table the `_NODE` annotation and `_TYPES` type-collection interpreters read; the composite kinds are `FieldDescriptor` union cases, not enum members, because they carry sub-shape. The bundle decodes once and is re-minted nowhere.
- Cases: `FieldDescriptor` is the `Struct` family tagged on `kind` — `scalar(FieldScalar)`, `array(element)`, `nested(ref)`, `mapping(key, value)`, `optional(element)`, and `union(members)` — so `array`/`optional` carry the one inner `FieldNode`, `mapping` carries the key/value pair, `union` carries the `Meta(min_length=1)`-bounded member tuple (an empty union is a decode-time `ValidationError` the `CLASSIFY` codec row folds onto the rail, so the `_NODE` `union` left-fold over `members[0]` is total by construction), and `nested` carries the forward owner name; the former parallel `element: FieldDescriptor | None` and `nested: str | None` optionals collapse into the case payload the `kind` selects, and the `FieldNode` alias unions the six leaves so `msgspec.json.Decoder(type=...)` discriminates over the closed leaf set rather than the open base. `FieldScalar` folds the eight wire primitives the C# seam emits — `i32`, `i64`, `f64`, `bool`, `string`, `key`, `bytes`, `decimal` — each mapping through the one `_SCALAR` table to its runtime type (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `ContentKey`, `bytes`, `decimal.Decimal`) the `_NODE` annotation interpreter and the `_TYPES` type-collection interpreter read; the third interpreter `_REFS` reads no scalar, carrying only the `nested` owner-name edges for the build order. A new scalar primitive is one `FieldScalar` member and one `_SCALAR` row; a new composite kind is one `FieldDescriptor` case plus one `_fold` match arm plus one constructor field on each of the three `FieldAlgebra` interpreters; never a parallel emitter.
- Fold: `_fold(node, alg)` is the one total recursion schema over the `FieldNode` union — a catamorphism parameterized by a `FieldAlgebra[T]` whose six `Callable` fields name the per-case constructors — closed by `assert_never` so an unmodelled kind is a compile-surfaced gap. It is written once and run by THREE interpreters over the identical descent. `_NODE: FieldAlgebra[ast.expr]` synthesizes the `ast` annotation directly (`array` -> `tuple[..., ...]` via `ast.Subscript`, `optional` -> `inner | None` via `ast.BinOp(ast.BitOr())`, `mapping` -> `dict[k, v]`, `union` left-folds members through `ast.BitOr`, `nested` -> the bare forward-ref `ast.Name`, `scalar` -> the dotted module+qualname node `_qual` builds), and its `ast.unparse` IS both the stub source line and the `defstruct` field type — so the divergence-free invariant is a literal identity, the schema and the stub descending from the same `ast.expr` rather than a parallel `_HINT` interpreter claimed to agree. A second `_HINT: FieldAlgebra[object]` producing runtime types by re-evaluating `tuple[e, ...]`/`e | None`/`reduce(acc | m, ...)` at fold time is the deleted form: `str | None` and `str | type` raise `TypeError` on a `nested` owner-name string, so `_HINT` diverged from `_NODE` exactly on `optional`/`union` over a nested ref, whereas the `ast.BinOp(ast.BitOr())` node never evaluates the operator and the forward ref stays a name the `namespace=` binds at class creation. `_TYPES: FieldAlgebra[frozenset[type]]` collects the scalar runtime types each descriptor references (composites union their children, `nested` contributes the empty set) so `_imports` synthesizes the stub import preamble AND `_owner_types` seeds the `defstruct` namespace from the same `_SCALAR`/`_BARE` policy `_NODE` reads — one fold feeding the annotation, the import statement, and the namespace binding so they cannot disagree on shape. `_REFS: FieldAlgebra[frozenset[str]]` is the mirror image collecting the `nested` owner-name edges (`scalar` contributes the empty set, `nested` carries the one ref) so `_ordered` topologically sequences the `defstruct` build off the same descent rather than a hand-walked edge scan. There is no second per-kind annotation method, parallel `_SCALAR_HINT` table, hand-keyed import list, or hand-written dependency walk. No annotation is rendered to a string and re-parsed through `ast.parse` — every node is synthesized, so a malformed sub-shape is impossible by construction.
- Entry: `StubCodegen.emit(raw, *, wire="json", target="both")` returns `RuntimeRail[GeneratedModule]` under one OTel span — it wraps the inner `_decode` thunk in the runtime `boundary` fence, selects the `msgspec` decoder for the inbound `WireFormat`, decodes the bundle once, runs `_fold` under `_NODE` to render `ast.ClassDef` nodes via `ast.unparse` when the `EmitTarget` requests `stub`, and reconstructs the owner structs from the same `ast.unparse(_fold(field, _NODE))` field-type strings — resolved through `defstruct(namespace=registry)` — that `msgspec.json.schema_components` projects to a `$defs` schema when it requests `schema`. The `RawBundle` = `Annotated[bytes, beartype.vale.Is[...]]` refinement is checked by `@beartype(conf=FAULT_CONF)` on `_decode` — the inner thunk the `boundary` wraps, not `emit` itself — so a refinement breach raises the canonical `BeartypeCallHintViolation` INSIDE the fence and the `CLASSIFY` `api` row folds it onto the one rail rather than letting it escape `emit` past the boundary, and the same fence catches a `msgspec` `DecodeError`; this binds the one shared runtime `FAULT_CONF`, never a private `violation_type=TypeError` conf that both re-mints the cached config and downgrades the breach to the catch-all `boundary` case. The span carries only the bounded `GeneratedModule.span_facts` scalar map (`owner_count`/`field_count` as native `int`, `schema_version` and `bundle_key.hex` as `str` — exactly the `str | int` set `Span.set_attributes` admits), never `msgspec.to_builtins(module)` which would attach the multi-KB rendered `source` and the nested `schema` dict (not a valid attribute value). Both writes sit behind the `is_recording()` gate the sibling `experiments/model.md#ASSET`, `experiments/inference.md#BAYESIAN`, and `graduation/handoff.md#GRADUATION` owners hold — the pre-boundary `wire`/`target` dims both arms need and the `Ok`-arm `span_facts` the rejected bundle has no module to carry — so a no-op span builds no attribute map. Span-egress ownership is split exactly as `evidence/identity#IDENTITY` `derived` and `transport/wire#WIRE_RAIL` `Decode._traced` split it: the `boundary` thunk wraps the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` `_emit` builder so the `emitted` receipt streams through the aspect's `Signals.emit` fold on the success path inside the fence (an emit-time render or sink raise folding onto the same rail), the `Ok` arm then sets `Status(StatusCode.OK)` itself — the one annotation the conversion does not own — and the `Error` arm is a bare `pass` because the `boundary` fence's `reliability/faults#FAULT` `_convert` already `record_exception`s the cause and sets `Status(StatusCode.ERROR, fault.tag)` on the same active span; a second `set_status(StatusCode.ERROR)` on the fault arm is the faults-owner-egress trample, the inline `Signals.emit(module)`-plus-fault-arm-`Signals.emit(Receipt.of(owner, fault))` double-emit is the deleted form `experiments/study.md#STUDY` names (the rejected receipt is not streamed; the fence's span annotation is the rejection evidence the sibling `pass`-arm owners hold), and a hand-built `structlog.get_logger().error` line is the deleted egress. `GeneratedModule` carries the rendered source, the optional schema `$defs`, the owner count, the field count, the C# `schema_version` (no longer decoded-and-discarded), and the bundle `ContentKey`; its `span_facts` is the one bounded-scalar fact source both the span and `contribute` read, and `contribute` renders that map to the `(Receipt, ...)` stream the `ReceiptContributor` port expects.
- Seam: `EvidenceBundle` is the decoded projection of the C# graduation-evidence bundle — the owners, the C# `schema_version`, and the `ContentKey` the C# side sealed it under. The C# seam chooses the wire format; `WireFormat` discriminates `json` versus `msgpack` so the one `msgspec` codec decodes either without a parallel reader, the format the seam sealed under being a parameter on `emit`, not a second entrypoint. This is the only place compute reads the C# evidence shape; it imports nothing from a C# interior and re-mints nothing, so the seam crosses once, offline, as bytes. Distinct from the `transport/serve#SERVE` `grpcio-tools`/`protoc` stub path — that compiles the C# `.proto` RPC descriptors into `_pb2` wire messages on the gated companion band; this owner projects the offline evidence bundle into domain `msgspec.Struct` stubs on the cp315 core, a different seam over a different artifact.
- Nested resolution: every `defstruct` field type is the `ast.unparse(_fold(field, _NODE))` string, so a `nested` field's annotation is the bare forward owner-name and a composite over a `nested` ref (`Owner | None`, `tuple[Owner, ...]`, `int | Owner`) is the string carrying that name unevaluated; `msgspec.defstruct(..., namespace=registry)` evaluates the string against the registry at class creation and binds the owner-name to the already-built sibling struct, so `msgspec.json.schema_components` cross-links the nested owner as a `#/$defs/<name>` `$ref` natively — no `schema_hook` and no unresolved-forward-type decode failure. Stringizing the whole annotation (rather than the eager `_HINT` `e | None`) is what lets `optional`/`union` over a nested ref resolve at all: `str | None` raises `TypeError` at fold time, but the deferred string `"Owner | None"` evaluates cleanly once `Owner` is in the namespace. `msgspec.StructMeta` resolves field types at class creation, not at schema-projection time, so the referenced sibling must already be in `registry` when its referrer is built; the seam does not guarantee that emission order, so `_ordered` topologically sequences the build off the `_REFS` `nested`-edge fold and a referenced sibling always precedes its referrer regardless of seam order. Sequential `defstruct(namespace=registry)` binds a `nested` ref only to an ALREADY-built sibling — a name still mid-construction is unresolvable (`schema_components` raises `NameError` on a self-referencing struct built this way), so the owner graph is a DAG by contract; `_ordered` carries a `visiting` gray set that turns a back-edge (`A -> B -> A` or a self-ref) into a deterministic `ValueError` the `boundary` fence converts to one typed fault, never the unbounded `RecursionError` an unguarded descent would blow. The `_NODE` `nested` arm renders the same forward name as a bare `ast.Name`, so the stub source and the schema agree the field references a sibling owner. `schema_hook` stays reserved for a genuinely custom-typed field (a type `schema_components` cannot introspect); the `key` scalar's `ContentKey` is itself a `Struct`, so it renders as a struct `$ref` without a hook.
- Target fold: `EmitTarget` discriminates `stub`, `schema`, and `both`, parameterizing the OUTPUT shape the one rail produces — `stub` renders only the `ast` module source, `schema` projects only the `msgspec.json.schema_components` `$defs` over the reconstructed owner structs, `both` carries each. Both projections descend the same `_fold` over the same decoded `OwnerDescriptor` tuple, so the stub source and the schema can never disagree on the field set; a consumer wanting only the wire-contract schema or only the importable stub selects a target rather than calling a second generator.
- Packages: stdlib `ast` (`ClassDef`/`AnnAssign`/`Subscript`/`Name`/`Attribute`/`Tuple`/`BinOp`/`BitOr`/`keyword`/`Constant`/`Import`/`ImportFrom`/`alias`/`Module`/`Pass`/`fix_missing_locations`/`unparse` — the one annotation source for both the stub line and the `defstruct` field-type string), stdlib `importlib.import_module` (seeds the `defstruct` namespace with the top-level scalar module per the `_BARE`/`_qual` policy), `msgspec` (`Struct` with `tag`/`tag_field`-discriminated `FieldNode` union, `field(default_factory=...)`, `json.Decoder`/`msgpack.Decoder` over the `WireFormat`-keyed pair, `json.schema_components`, `defstruct` resolving each unparsed-annotation string field type through `namespace=`), `beartype` (`@beartype` on `_decode` binding the runtime `FAULT_CONF`, `beartype.vale.Is` refinement on the `RawBundle` alias), `opentelemetry-api` (`trace.get_tracer`/`Tracer.start_as_current_span`/`Span.is_recording`/`Span.set_attributes`/`Span.set_status`/`StatusCode` for the projection span), `expression` (`Map.empty`, `Ok`/`Error`), stdlib `functools.reduce` (the `_qual` dotted-attribute walk and the `_NODE` `union` left-fold over `ast.BitOr`), runtime (`RuntimeRail`/`boundary` the one fault fence, `FAULT_CONF` the one shared domain `BeartypeConf`, `ContentKey`, `Receipt`/`ReceiptContributor`/`Redaction`/`receipted` the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` egress aspect the `_emit` builder wears, the aspect's `Signals.emit` fold referenced as the egress contract rather than imported here).
- Growth: a new wire primitive is one `FieldScalar` member plus one `_SCALAR` row the `_NODE` annotation and `_TYPES` type-collection interpreters absorb (the annotation renders it, the `_TYPES` fold imports its module into the preamble and binds it into the `defstruct` namespace with zero extra surface; `_REFS` ignores it since a scalar names no owner edge); a new composite shape is one `FieldDescriptor` case plus one `FieldNode` union member plus one `_fold` match arm plus one constructor field on each of the three `FieldAlgebra` interpreters; a new inbound wire format is one `WireFormat` member plus one decoder row; a new output artifact is one `EmitTarget` member plus one fold arm; zero new surface, no external-package member beyond the runtime port and the woven codec/contract/telemetry libraries, no parallel emitter, no per-kind annotation method, no second scalar table, no hand-keyed import list, no hand-written dependency walk.
- Boundary: codegen emits type stubs and JSON Schema only — `msgspec.Struct` declarations and their `$defs` — never runtime behavior, never a re-derived evidence shape, and never a C# source shape. The C# graduation-evidence bundle is the upstream authority; this owner is a one-directional offline consumer that names no C# interior owner row. `ast`, `msgspec`, `beartype`, the OTel API, and the runtime `Signals` fold are all pure-Python and reflectable on cp315, so there is no deploy gate — distinct from the `grpcio-tools` companion the proto path rides. A string-templated annotation re-parsed through `ast.parse`, a second `_SCALAR_HINT` table racing the node table, a parallel `_HINT: FieldAlgebra[object]` interpreter re-evaluating `tuple[e, ...]`/`e | None`/`reduce(acc | m, ...)` at fold time where it raises `TypeError` on `optional`/`union` over a `nested` owner-name string (`str | None` unsupported) and so diverges from the `_NODE` ast it was claimed to mirror — the `ast.unparse(_fold(field, _NODE))` field-type string is the resolution, deferring the operator to `defstruct(namespace=)` class-creation eval, a single-pass `defstruct` build in seam order where a `nested` ref to a later-emitted sibling raises an unbound-name fault at class creation because `StructMeta` resolves field types eagerly (the dependency-ordered `_ordered` build off the `_REFS` edge fold is the resolution), an unguarded `_ordered` descent where a cyclic owner graph blows the stack with `RecursionError` instead of the `visiting`-gray-set `ValueError` the fence converts to one typed fault, a phantom `schema_hook=_ref_hook` doing the forward-ref binding that `defstruct(..., namespace=registry)` already owns, a `defstruct` namespace seeded only with sibling structs where the unparsed annotation also names the scalar modules/types (so `decimal.Decimal`/`ContentKey` resolve only when `_owner_types` seeds the namespace off the same `_TYPES`/`_BARE`/`_qual` policy), parallel `element`/`nested` optionals racing the descriptor discriminant, an unbounded `UnionField.members` where a zero-member union crashes the `_NODE` `members[0]` left-fold with an `IndexError` instead of the `Meta(min_length=1)` decode-time `ValidationError` the `CLASSIFY` codec row folds onto the rail, a JSON-only decoder where the seam can seal MessagePack, a generated module that discards the C# `schema_version`, a `dict[str, Any]` mutable default schema carrier, a `@beartype` fence on `emit` itself where a refinement breach escapes past the `boundary` instead of folding onto the rail, a private `BeartypeConf(violation_type=TypeError)` re-minting the shared `FAULT_CONF` and downgrading the breach to the catch-all `boundary` case, a `msgspec.to_builtins(module)` span-attribute dump attaching the unbounded `source` and the nested `schema` dict where only the bounded `span_facts` scalars are admissible, an un-gated `span.set_attributes` where the sibling owners gate both writes behind `is_recording()` so a no-op span builds no attribute map, a second `set_status(StatusCode.ERROR)` on the `Error` arm re-annotating the status the `boundary` fence's `_convert` already records on the active span (the faults-owner-egress trample) where only the `Ok` arm's `Status(StatusCode.OK)` is this owner's to set, a generated stub body emitting class declarations with no import preamble so the `Struct` base and the `decimal`/`ContentKey` scalars resolve to unbound names, a hand-keyed import list racing the `_qual`/`_BARE` annotation policy where the `_TYPES` fold derives the preamble, an inline `Signals.emit(module)`-plus-fault-arm-`Signals.emit(Receipt.of(owner, fault))` double-emit threaded through the `emit` body where the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` aspect over the `_emit` builder owns egress inside the `boundary` thunk (the deleted form `experiments/study.md#STUDY` names and the sibling `graduation/handoff.md#GRADUATION`/`experiments/inference.md#BAYESIAN`/`experiments/model.md#ASSET` replaced), an inline `structlog` line where the aspect's `Signals.emit` fold owns receipt egress, a stub generator with no contributed receipt where every sibling evidence owner emits one, and a re-implementation of the `transport/serve#SERVE` proto-stub path are the deleted forms.

## [03]-[RESEARCH]

- [ALGEBRA_CATAMORPHISM]: the descriptor descent is one recursion schema `_fold(node, alg)` over the `FieldNode` union, parameterized by a `FieldAlgebra[T]` whose six `Callable` constructor fields are the per-case interpreters — the tagless-final / catamorphism collapse that writes the traversal once and runs it under three interpreters: `_NODE` (`ast.expr` annotation nodes whose `ast.unparse` IS both the stub source line and the `defstruct` field-type string, so the schema and the stub cannot diverge), `_TYPES` (`frozenset[type]` scalar-type collection feeding both the stub preamble and the `defstruct` namespace seed), and `_REFS` (`frozenset[str]` `nested`-edge collection feeding the dependency-ordered `defstruct` build), with no duplicated match shape, no parallel scalar table, and no hand-written dependency walk. A separate `_HINT: FieldAlgebra[object]` interpreter producing the runtime types by eager `|`/subscription is the deleted form — `str | None` over a `nested` owner-name string raises `TypeError` at fold time, where the deferred unparsed annotation string evaluates cleanly under `defstruct(namespace=)` at class creation. The stdlib `ast` arms build nodes directly rather than rendering a string re-parsed through `ast.parse(..., mode="eval")` — `ast.Subscript(value, slice, ctx)` with an `ast.Tuple` slice expresses `tuple[T, ...]` and `dict[K, V]`, `ast.BinOp(left, ast.BitOr(), right)` expresses the PEP 604 `T | None` and `A | B | C` union the C# wire union projects to, `_qual` walks a type's `__module__`+`__qualname__` into a dotted `ast.Attribute`/`ast.Name` chain so `decimal.Decimal` resolves without a hand-keyed node, and `ast.fix_missing_locations` over the assembled `ast.Module` seeds the line/column metadata `ast.unparse` requires. The `FieldNode` leaf-union alias is the decoder target so the `tag_field`/`tag` `Struct` keywords select the case off the `kind` field at the C boundary over the closed leaf set. All spellings verify against the cp315 stdlib `ast` grammar and the branch `libs/python/.api/msgspec.md` (`Struct` `tag`/`tag_field`, `json.Decoder`/`msgpack.Decoder`, `json.schema_components`, `defstruct` with `namespace=`, `field`).
- [WOVEN_RAIL]: the decode-fold-render is one integrated rail composing the admitted libraries as a single flow — `beartype.vale.Is` refines the `RawBundle` input on the shared `Annotated` alias the `@beartype(conf=FAULT_CONF)` boundary checks on the inner `_decode` thunk (NOT on `emit`, so the refinement breach raises inside the `boundary` fence and folds onto the rail, never escaping the owner), `msgspec` owns the polymorphic wire decode over the `WireFormat`-keyed `json.Decoder`/`msgpack.Decoder` pair and the `json.schema_components` `$defs` projection over the `defstruct(..., namespace=registry)`-reconstructed owner types whose forward `nested` refs resolve to the registered sibling structs and emit as `#/$defs/<name>` `$ref`s natively (no `schema_hook`, no phantom `_ref_hook`), the one shared runtime `FAULT_CONF` = `BeartypeConf(violation_type=BeartypeCallHintViolation)` raises the canonical root the `CLASSIFY` `api` row classifies (`.api/beartype.md` `violation_type` IMPLEMENTATION_LAW; never a private `violation_type=TypeError` conf that both re-mints the cached config and lands the breach in the catch-all `boundary` case), the OTel API `trace.get_tracer`/`start_as_current_span` opens the projection span carrying ONLY the bounded `GeneratedModule.span_facts` `str | int` scalar map behind the `is_recording()` gate (`.api/opentelemetry-api.md` `set_attributes` admits `str | bool | int | float | Sequence[...]`, so the unbounded `source` string and the nested `schema` dict are never attached, and a no-op span builds no attribute map) with `Status(StatusCode.OK)` set on the `Ok` arm only — the success annotation the `boundary` fence's `_convert` does not own, leaving the `Status(StatusCode.ERROR, fault.tag)` egress to the conversion that records the cause on the same active span rather than a second `set_status` trample (the `evidence/identity#IDENTITY` `derived` and `transport/wire#WIRE_RAIL` `Decode._traced` span-then-fence discipline) — and the `@receipted(_REDACTION)` egress aspect wearing the `_emit` builder inside the `boundary` thunk streams the `emitted` receipt through its `Signals.emit` fold on the success path, the `Error` arm a bare `pass` whose rejection evidence is the fence's `_convert` span annotation (the sibling `pass`-arm owners' convention), never the inline `Signals.emit(module)`-plus-fault-arm-`Signals.emit(Receipt.of(owner, fault))` double-emit `experiments/study.md#STUDY` names deleted and never an inline `structlog` line, which `observability/receipts#RECEIPT` owns. The libraries weave into one `RuntimeRail`-returning surface rather than flat one-shot uses, and the rail re-mints no provider — it reads the `observability/telemetry#TELEMETRY`-installed tracer and the `Signals`-configured logger through the global APIs. The `transport/serve#SERVE` `grpcio-tools` proto-stub path stays the distinct gated companion seam; this owner's `ast`/`msgspec`/`beartype`/OTel/runtime stack is cp315-clean and rides the core floor.
