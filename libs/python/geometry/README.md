# [PY_GEOMETRY]

`geometry` is the host-free geometry and IFC/BIM evaluation companion of the Python branch — an independent peer producer, never a Rasm consumer. It owns the IfcOpenShell GLB tessellation daemon, scan verification from ingest to watertight reconstruction, IFC analysis, authoring, costing, and structural evaluation, exact mesh algebra and non-manifold topology, graph analytics, and the Ladybug Tools building-physics band. Every crossing is content-keyed and receipted, produced off the event loop for the C# Bim/Compute rail, the TypeScript viewer, and the artifacts report plane.

It meets C# only at the wire through content identity and the GLB tessellation rail over the `ComputeService`/`ArtifactSync` gRPC contract, and graduates evidence through the geometry-minted `rasm.geometry.graduation` spine, never an import.

## [02]-[DOMAIN_PACKAGES]

Domain libraries the folder admits; substrate lives in `[03]-[SUBSTRATE_PACKAGES]`.
