# [TYPESCRIPT_LANGUAGE]

TypeScript 7 on the `tsgo` native compiler is the active language surface, with the stable `tsc` peer-check as the dual-compiler floor. The workspace manifest owns `target`, `module`, `strict`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `verbatimModuleSyntax`; this page is the language-feature law for choosing type-expression, inference, dispatch, and module forms before adding a local abstraction. Runtime-authority shape lives in `shapes.md`; rail and effect composition lives in `rails-and-effects.md`.

## [1]-[ACTIVE_SURFACE]

[ACTIVE_SURFACE]:
- Compiler: `tsgo` native canonical typecheck; stable `tsc` peer-check is the second floor
- Module mode: `verbatimModuleSyntax` — `import type`/`export type` explicit, no elision
- Strictness: `strict`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables`
- Inference baseline: inference-first from runtime anchors; `const` type parameters preserve literal narrowing
- Absence baseline: `Option<T>` in domain; `null`/`undefined` only at the serialization seam
- Export baseline: one or two named exports per module; every other symbol `_`-prefixed; no barrel files, no default exports, no namespace re-export
- Ecosystem baseline: the `effect` core and the `@effect/*` set are the standard library

Treat source files as modern Effect-native TypeScript, not compatibility layers. Replace older spellings, overload families, standalone type aliases, branded-type exports, and JS stdlib reflexes whenever the active surface or the Effect ecosystem carries the concept directly.

[COMPILER_DIVERGENCE]:
- Law: `tsgo` is the canonical fast typecheck and `tsc` is the conformance floor — a construct accepts only when both agree, and `tsc` is authoritative on any divergence because it is the conformance reference the type system is specified against; a `tsgo`-only acceptance is a defect to repair at the shape, never a license to ship.
- Law: a construct that diverges between the two compilers is rewritten to the form both accept, not gated behind a directive — the doctrine's deep `infer`-decomposition, tuple-budgeted recursion, and `as const satisfies` vocabularies are chosen partly because they are the constructs least exposed to checker divergence.
- Reject: a `// @ts-expect-error` or `// @ts-ignore` masking a `tsc`/`tsgo` disagreement, a build that runs only one of the two checkers, and a type so baroque that only one compiler resolves it — collapse it to the form both prove.

## [2]-[CANONICAL_CHOOSER]

Use the active TypeScript surface directly. This chooser owns type-expression, inference, dispatch, and module forms. Runtime-authority construction (`Schema.Class`, `Model.Class`, `Data.TaggedEnum`) is owned by `shapes.md`; rail composition by `rails-and-effects.md`; JS-stdlib replacement by `system-apis.md`. Replace an older spelling or local machinery when the active surface owns the behavior.

## [3]-[LANGUAGE_FORM_CONTRACTS]

Use these contracts when the chooser names the form but code still needs a placement rule.

[VOCABULARY_DERIVATION_SITE]:
- Use when: one `as const satisfies Record<...>` anchor can drive a discriminant union, per-key output types, and polymorphic dispatch from a single declaration.
- Accept: `keyof typeof` for the discriminant, indexed access for per-key output, a conditional return type carrying the discriminant to the result, and `NoInfer` where a second parameter must conform rather than widen.
- Reject: a hand-listed union beside the vocabulary, a parallel mapped declaration per axis, and an overload family where one conditional return type carries the polymorphism.
- Law: rename a vocabulary key and every derivation and dispatch site fails simultaneously; the anchor is the single source the keys, output types, and dispatch all read.
- Boundary: a vocabulary whose rows carry runtime behavior — schedule, status, log level — is a policy owner read by `surfaces-and-dispatch.md`; this site owns the type-level derivation algebra.

```ts conceptual
import { Effect, Option } from "effect"

const _Verbs = {
  read:   { idempotent: true,  returns: "option" as const },
  open:   { idempotent: false, returns: "row"    as const },
  retire: { idempotent: true,  returns: "void"   as const },
} as const satisfies Record<string, { idempotent: boolean; returns: "row" | "option" | "void" }>

type _Verb = keyof typeof _Verbs
type _Key<K extends _Verb> = string & { readonly verb: K } // per-verb key so NoInfer is load-bearing, not inert
type _Result<K extends _Verb> = // one conditional return carries the per-key polymorphism; an overload family is the rejected form
  (typeof _Verbs)[K]["returns"] extends "row"    ? Effect.Effect<Row, Missing>
  : (typeof _Verbs)[K]["returns"] extends "option" ? Effect.Effect<Option.Option<Row>, never>
  : Effect.Effect<void, Missing>

const _dispatch = <K extends _Verb>(verb: K, key: NoInfer<_Key<K>>): _Result<K> => // NoInfer pins K from verb alone, so key conforms and never widens the union
  (_Verbs[verb].returns === "row"    ? _store.row(key)
  : _Verbs[verb].returns === "option" ? _store.find(key)
  :                                     _store.retire(key)) as _Result<K>
```

[TYPE_PARAMETER_SITE]:
- Use when: a type parameter's distribution, variance, or inference position determines whether one declaration yields the whole family or quietly mis-evaluates.
- Accept: naked `T` for per-member union evaluation, `[T] extends [U]` for union-as-unit, multi-clause `infer` to decompose a multi-channel carrier in one pass, `in`/`out` to fix variance at declaration, and `NoInfer` to pin which position drives inference.
- Reject: an unintended distributive evaluation when a union is passed as a unit, a lazily-inferred variance that surprises a consumer, and sequential conditional extraction where one multi-clause `infer` decomposes every channel at once.
- Law: `extends` in generic position is an upper-bound constraint; combined with a conditional return type it narrows input and output in one signature, deleting the overload family.
- Boundary: recursion past the instantiation depth limit uses a tuple-accumulator budget; a deeper transform is quarantined, never left to hit the cap.

```ts conceptual
import { Effect } from "effect"

type _Channels<T> = [T] extends [Effect.Effect<infer A, infer E, infer R>] // [T] unit-wraps so a carrier union never distributes; one infer pass decomposes all three channels
  ? { readonly success: A; readonly error: E; readonly context: R }
  : never

type _Paths<T, Trail extends ReadonlyArray<unknown> = []> = // tuple accumulator budgets recursion below the instantiation-depth cap
  Trail["length"] extends 8 ? never
  : T extends ReadonlyArray<unknown> ? never
  : T extends object
    ? { [K in keyof T & string]: K | `${K}.${_Paths<T[K], [...Trail, unknown]>}` }[keyof T & string]
    : never

interface _Resolver<out A, out E, in R> { // declaration-site variance: A/E produced, R consumed, so assignability is pinned at the type, never lazily inferred
  readonly run: (deps: R) => Effect.Effect<A, E>
  readonly at: <P extends _Paths<A>>(path: NoInfer<P>) => (deps: R) => Effect.Effect<A, E> // NoInfer forces P to conform to the derived path family; R stays input-only, so `in R` holds
}
```

[PROJECTION_ALGEBRA_SITE]:
- Use when: one canonical type yields a family of views, and a view derives by one set-theoretic operator.
- Accept: `Pick`/`Omit` for projection and elimination, `Partial` for optional lift, `Extract`/`Exclude` for union filtering by assignability, and a template-literal mapped type for an accessor or event-name family.
- Reject: a standalone declaration for a view that one utility application gives unless three or more consumers reference it; below that threshold the projection inlines at the call site.
- Law: when the canonical type has a `Schema`/`Model` anchor, `Schema.pick`/`Schema.omit`/`Schema.partial` own the projection and the TS utility forms do not — that boundary belongs to `shapes.md`; this site owns projection over a pure structural type with no runtime authority.
- Boundary: a homomorphic mapped type (`keyof T`) preserves source modifiers; a non-homomorphic one starts fresh — modifier inheritance is the selection axis, not a style choice.

```ts conceptual
type Row = { // pure structural anchor, no runtime authority; a Schema-anchored row routes projection to Schema.pick/omit instead
  readonly id: string; readonly owner: string; readonly label: string
  readonly state: "active" | "archived" | "purging"; readonly stamped: Date
}
type _Key      = Pick<Row, "id" | "owner">                    // projection by membership
type _Patch    = Partial<Pick<Row, "label" | "state">>        // optional lift over a projection
type _Terminal = Exclude<Row["state"], "active" | "archived"> // union filter by assignability narrows to "purging"
type _Frozen   = { readonly [K in keyof Row]: Row[K] }        // homomorphic: keyof Row inherits source readonly modifiers
type _Probes   = { +readonly [K in keyof Row as `peek${Capitalize<K & string>}`]-?: () => Row[K] } // non-homomorphic remap: modifiers start fresh, set explicitly
```

[MODULE_SURFACE_SITE]:
- Use when: a module declares its public names or consumes another module's surface.
- Accept: one or two named exports, `import type`/`export type` under `verbatimModuleSyntax`, and every non-exported symbol carrying the `_` prefix integrated into the exports.
- Reject: default exports, barrel re-export files, namespace re-exports, a `const X = _X` alias that promotes a private symbol, and an exported `_`-prefixed symbol — name it correctly at the declaration site or remove the export.
- Law: a `_`-prefixed function exists only as a closure inside a scoped constructor or as a module-level semantic anchor serving two or more call sites; a single-caller private function inlines into the export.
- Boundary: package topology and the browser/node/neutral publication split belong to the Nx module-boundary tag graph in the workspace manifest; this site owns the per-module export shape.

```ts conceptual
import { Array as A, Data, Number as N } from "effect"

type _Command = Data.TaggedEnum<{
  readonly Stage:  { readonly id: string; readonly weight: number }
  readonly Hold:   { readonly id: string }
  readonly Retire: { readonly id: string }
}>
const _Command: Data.TaggedEnum.Constructor<_Command> = Data.taggedEnum<_Command>() // explicit type: an exported surface is isolatedDeclarations-emittable

export const dispatch = (env: { readonly floor: number }): (commands: readonly [_Command, ...ReadonlyArray<_Command>]) => ReadonlyArray<string> => { // floor is captured once, so _render is a module-semantic anchor, not a per-call rebuild
  const _render = _Command.$match({ // $match is the sole egress; a fourth verb breaks here at compile time
    Stage:  ({ id, weight }) => `${id}=${N.max(weight, env.floor)}`,
    Hold:   ({ id }) => `${id}~`,
    Retire: ({ id }) => `${id}-`,
  })
  return (commands) => A.map(commands, _render) // one entrypoint; arity rides the non-empty tuple, verb rides the tag, no batch flag
}
```

[ABSENCE_FORM_SITE]:
- Use when: a value can be absent, and absence must stay distinct from failure and from a present `null`.
- Accept: `Option<T>` in domain code with `Option.fromNullable` at the boundary, `Option.match`/`Option.getOrElse` at consumption, `Schema.optionalWith(field, { as: "Option" })` as the only Schema absence form, and `undefined` only as the decoded shape under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
- Reject: `null`/`undefined` crossing a domain boundary, a present-but-meaningless sentinel, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` results on an open key consumed without an `Option` lift, and bare `Schema.optional`/`Schema.NullOr`/`Schema.UndefinedOr` on a domain field — each re-admits `undefined`/`null` into the decoded interior that `Schema.optionalWith({ as: "Option" })` would have closed.
- Law: indexed access into a closed vocabulary keyed by a `keyof typeof V` value carries its membership proof in the key type, so it is exempt from the `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`-to-`Option` rule — `_Policy[this.reason]` and `Severity[level]` are total; the rule applies to an open `string`/`number` index, a foreign array offset, or a `Record` whose key is not proven a member.
- Boundary: cause-bearing absence — unavailable, degraded, pending — is a tagged family owned by `boundaries.md`, never `Option.none`; this site owns the no-cause absence form.

```ts conceptual
import { Array, Effect, Option, ParseResult, Schema } from "effect"

const _Severity = { info: 0, warn: 1, error: 2 } as const satisfies Record<string, number>

const _Row = Schema.Struct({
  status: Schema.Literal("active", "archived"),
  label: Schema.optionalWith(Schema.NonEmptyTrimmedString, { as: "Option" }),
  level: Schema.Literal("info", "warn", "error"),
})

const _decodeRow = Schema.decodeUnknown(_Row)
const _summarize = (raw: ReadonlyArray<unknown>): Effect.Effect<string, ParseResult.ParseError> =>
  Effect.forEach(raw, (row) => _decodeRow(row)).pipe( // decode once at the seam; ParseError rides the channel
    Effect.map((rows) =>
      Array.findFirst(rows, (row) => row.status === "active").pipe(
        Option.orElse(() => Array.head(rows)),
        Option.match({
          onNone: () => "<empty>",
          onSome: (row) =>
            Option.getOrElse(
              Option.map(row.label, (label) => `${label}@${_Severity[row.level]}`), // keyof-typed index: total, exempt
              () => `<unlabeled>@${_Severity[row.level]}`,
            ),
        }),
      ),
    ),
  )
```

[KERNEL_EXEMPTION_SITE]:
- Use when: a tight decode loop, a parser scanning a byte buffer, a `yield*` generator body inside `Effect.gen`, or a `Schema.transformOrFail` parse step is measurably faster as statements than as a combinator fold, and the seam is the platform-forced or measured kernel the `EXPRESSION_SPINE` law names.
- Accept: a `for`/`while` loop or mutable accumulator confined to one `_`-prefixed kernel function whose signature is total over its input and whose result is an immutable value or a typed rail; the `Effect.gen` generator body, where `yield*` sequencing is the idiomatic spine, not a statement violation.
- Reject: a statement-bearing loop outside a named kernel, a mutable accumulator that escapes the kernel as interior state, and a `// BOUNDARY ADAPTER` mark on ordinary domain logic that a `pipe`/`Array.reduce`/`Match` fold expresses without measurement pressure.
- Law: the kernel is closed — it admits a value and emits a value or rail, never a partial or a leaked mutable reference — and every statement-bearing kernel carries the `// BOUNDARY ADAPTER` mark or sits inside `Effect.gen`, so the exemption is recoverable from the declaration and the surrounding expression spine is unbroken.
- Boundary: the worker/marshal and event-callback statement seams are owned by `boundaries.md`; this site owns the in-process compute kernel exemption.

```ts conceptual
import { ParseResult, Schema } from "effect"

const _scanFrames = (bytes: Uint8Array): ReadonlyArray<number> => {
  const offsets: Array<number> = [] // BOUNDARY ADAPTER: measured parse kernel, result detaches as readonly
  for (let i = 0; i + 4 <= bytes.length; i += 4) {
    if (bytes[i] === 0x47 && bytes[i + 1] === 0x4c) offsets.push(i)
  }
  return offsets
}

const _admit = Schema.transformOrFail(Schema.String, Schema.Number, {
  decode: (s, _, ast) => {
    const n = Number(s) // dependent bind: parse must precede the range check
    return Number.isFinite(n) ? ParseResult.succeed(n) : ParseResult.fail(new ParseResult.Type(ast, s))
  },
  encode: (n) => ParseResult.succeed(String(n)),
})
```

## [4]-[ABSTRACTION_COLLAPSE_TESTS]

Use these tests before keeping a local abstraction beside a language or ecosystem primitive.

[TYPE_PROLIFERATION]:
- Smell: a standalone `type`/`interface` mirrors a shape that `typeof anchor.Type` or `keyof typeof vocab` already gives, or an `interface IService` sits beside an `Effect.Service` class.
- Collapse: delete the type and derive it from the runtime anchor; the `Effect.Service` class is both value and type.
- Done when: every consumer references the derived type and no parallel declaration restates the runtime shape.

[BRAND_SPRAWL]:
- Smell: a `type Id = string & Brand<"Id">` or a `const _Id = Schema.String.pipe(Schema.brand("Id"))` exists as a standalone module-level symbol before its owning class.
- Collapse: inline `Schema.brand("Id")` as a field modifier in the owning `Schema.Class`/`Model.Class`.
- Done when: the brand lives in field position and no standalone branded-primitive symbol is exported.

[MATCH_OVER_VOCAB]:
- Smell: a `Match.value`/`Match.when` chain classifies into tiers or categories that an `as const satisfies Record` vocabulary already maps.
- Collapse: classify through vocabulary field lookup or threshold iteration; reserve `Match` for structural and predicate dispatch on non-keyed shapes.
- Done when: the keyed dispatch reads the vocabulary and no `Match` arm re-encodes the vocabulary's knowledge.

[SURFACE_FACADE]:
- Smell: a module exists only to re-export another, collect names from several owners, or wrap an external API with a rename.
- Collapse: import the real owner by name; integrate the logic into the one or two exports the module owns.
- Done when: readers find the implementation owner without traversing a barrel, and no `_`-prefixed symbol is exported.

[STDLIB_LEAKAGE]:
- Smell: `new Map()`/`new Set()`/`Array.from`/`Object.entries`/`null` appear in domain code where the Effect ecosystem provides `HashMap`/`HashSet`/`Chunk`/the `Record` module/`Option`.
- Collapse: use the Effect data structure that carries structural equality and persistent update.
- Done when: JS stdlib collections and `null` appear only at FFI and serialization boundaries.
