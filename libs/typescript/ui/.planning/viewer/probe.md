# [UI_PROBE]

The one render-evidence owner: benchmark and receipt are two lanes of a single discipline — capture a local truth with the render engines' own counters, pair it with the wire-decoded claim, and render the comparison as operator evidence that never gates, never faults, never retries. The benchmark lane folds deck's `DeckMetrics` sink and the frame-loop timer into one bounded seed fold, mirrors the host fingerprint locally so divergent numbers carry their divergence context, and joins claim rows against local rows BY LABEL into a comparison board. The receipt lane captures a deterministic fixed-extent framebuffer through the renderer's async readback, delegates the hash to the branch's one content mint, and compares structurally against the wire `RenderReceipt` — both proofs render side by side. Claims arrive already identity-gated (`Claim.admit` at `core/interchange/codec` refuses a foreign-host claim before this module sees it), and the local fingerprint exists to explain deltas, never to admit or refuse. The module is `ui/viewer/src/probe.ts`.

## [02]-[METRIC_FOLD]

[METRIC_FOLD]:
- Owner: `Probe.rows` — the local capture: deck's `_onMetrics` callback is the GPU-side sink (`DeckMetrics` — `fps`, `gpuTime`, `cpuTime`, `pickTime`, `gpuMemory`), folded into a bounded rolling window whose projections run as ONE seed fold — raw sums accumulate in a single `Chunk.reduce` pass and means project at read, so a new statistic (a peak, a p95 seed) is one seed field and one row, never a second traversal; the frame loop contributes a frame-time row measured inside its own tick (the loop is already the timing source, no second RAF); each captured quantity lands as the SAME metric row shape the wire claim carries — `label`/`value`/`unit` derives from `Claim` itself — so comparison is a keyed join, not a shape adaptation.
- Packages: `@deck.gl/core` (`DeckMetrics` via the `_onMetrics` prop on the surface's overlay); `@rasm/ts/core` (`Claim` — the metric row shape IS its vocabulary); `effect` (`Chunk`, `Number`, `pipe`).
- Law: probes are passive — metric capture never alters render behavior (no forced redraws, no `_animate` flips for measurement's sake); an idle viewport reports idle numbers truthfully.
- Law: windows are policy rows — sample count and projection kind live in one `as const` record; a per-metric bespoke window is the named defect.
- Law: the trace renders as a live series, never table rows — `Probe.aligned(trace)` projects the rolling window into the aligned columns `view/chart#SERIES_SURFACE` streams through `setData` (the metric board is a chart cohort synced by one key), and the summary rows feed the claim board; a metric timeline rendered through `view/table` is the named defect.
- Law: residency metrics tap the scene broadcast — `scene#RESIDENCY_GRAFT`'s surplus arrival lane feeds an arrival-rate row and `Glb.Loop.refusals` feeds the refusal-rate row beside it, both in the same trace shape — broadcast taps, never a second port subscription.
- Boundary: `Deck`/renderer acquisition is `geo`/`scene`'s — the sinks arrive as wiring parameters; React tree render cost is app-plane telemetry, not this probe; render-vital emission to the OTel spine is the runtime plane's, fed by an app-composed tap over these local rows, so this probe stays a display surface and mints no instrument.

```typescript
import type { DeckMetrics } from "@deck.gl/core"
import type { Claim } from "@rasm/ts/core"
import { Chunk, Number, pipe } from "effect"

type Metric = Claim["metrics"][number]

const _WINDOW = { samples: 120 } as const

declare namespace Probe {
  type Trace = Chunk.Chunk<DeckMetrics>
}

type _Sums = { readonly count: number; readonly fps: number; readonly gpu: number; readonly cpu: number; readonly pick: number; readonly mem: number }

const _SEED: _Sums = { count: 0, fps: 0, gpu: 0, cpu: 0, pick: 0, mem: 0 }

const _stepped = (acc: _Sums, sample: DeckMetrics): _Sums => ({
  count: acc.count + 1,
  fps: acc.fps + sample.fps,
  gpu: acc.gpu + sample.gpuTime,
  cpu: acc.cpu + sample.cpuTime,
  pick: acc.pick + sample.pickTime,
  mem: Number.max(acc.mem, sample.gpuMemory), // a gauge windows as its peak, never a mean
})

const _observe = (trace: Probe.Trace, sample: DeckMetrics): Probe.Trace =>
  Chunk.takeRight(Chunk.append(trace, sample), _WINDOW.samples)

const _rows = (trace: Probe.Trace): ReadonlyArray<Metric> =>
  pipe(Chunk.reduce(trace, _SEED, _stepped), (sums) =>
    sums.count === 0
      ? [] // an empty window carries no rows — a zero-sample mean is fabricated evidence
      : [
          { label: "fps", value: sums.fps / sums.count, unit: "1/s" },
          { label: "gpu-time", value: sums.gpu / sums.count, unit: "ms" },
          { label: "cpu-time", value: sums.cpu / sums.count, unit: "ms" },
          { label: "pick-time", value: sums.pick / sums.count, unit: "ms" },
          { label: "gpu-memory", value: sums.mem, unit: "bytes" },
        ])

const _aligned = (trace: Probe.Trace): readonly [Float64Array, Float64Array, Float64Array, Float64Array] =>
  pipe(Chunk.toReadonlyArray(trace), (samples) => [
    Float64Array.from(samples, (_, rank) => rank),
    Float64Array.from(samples, (sample) => sample.fps),
    Float64Array.from(samples, (sample) => sample.gpuTime),
    Float64Array.from(samples, (sample) => sample.cpuTime),
  ] as const)
```

## [03]-[HOST_MIRROR]

[HOST_MIRROR]:
- Owner: `Probe.host` — the local fingerprint mirroring the wire's `HostFingerprint` fields: `print` is the app's own identity host value handed in as a parameter — the probe never mints identity; `cores` reads `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`; `runtime` reads the user-agent brand; `machine`/`arch` read the WebGPU adapter info (`vendor`/`architecture` — the adapter probe already ran at `scene`'s backend selection, so the info arrives as an `Option` parameter from the renderer row, never a second `requestAdapter`); absent WebGPU, `Option.none` folds to the declared `"<unavailable>"` literal rather than fabricated values.
- Packages: `@rasm/ts/core` (`Claim` — `Claim.Host` IS `HostFingerprint`); `effect` (`Option`, `pipe`); `@webgpu/types` (ambient adapter-info shape).
- Law: the local fingerprint NEVER gates — the identity gate lives at the codec (`Claim.admit` against `AppIdentity`); this probe exists to display divergence context (different GPU, fewer cores) beside metric deltas.
- Law: fingerprint capture is once-per-session — the value is stable for the process lifetime and its atom pins through `Atom.keepAlive`, so the registry's idle TTL never re-runs the capture.

```typescript
import { Claim } from "@rasm/ts/core"
import { Option } from "effect"

const _host = (
  print: string,
  adapter: Option.Option<{ readonly vendor: string; readonly architecture: string }>,
): Claim.Host =>
  pipe(
    Option.getOrElse(adapter, () => ({ vendor: "<unavailable>", architecture: "<unavailable>" })),
    (info) =>
      new Claim.Host({
        print,
        machine: info.vendor,
        arch: info.architecture,
        cores: Number.max(1, globalThis.navigator.hardwareConcurrency),
        runtime: globalThis.navigator.userAgent,
      }),
  )
```

## [04]-[CLAIM_BOARD]

[CLAIM_BOARD]:
- Owner: `Probe.board` — the comparison fold: join the admitted claim's metric rows with the local rows BY LABEL (a keyed record join — labels present on only one side render as one-sided evidence, never dropped), compute the signed delta per joined row, and pair the claim's fingerprint with the local one for the divergence header; the result is one board value the panel renders — claim column, local column, delta column, host context.
- Law: units agree or the row is incomparable — a label joined across differing units renders both values with no delta, because a silent unit conversion is fabricated science.
- Law: display formats through `Format` number rows (`system/intl`); tones key off delta sign through the `[6]` table.
- Boundary: claims arrive already admitted; persisting local runs as new claims is app egress through wire encode.

```typescript
import { Array, HashMap, HashSet } from "effect"

declare namespace Probe {
  type BoardRow = {
    readonly label: string
    readonly claimed: Option.Option<Metric>
    readonly local: Option.Option<Metric>
    readonly delta: Option.Option<number>
  }
}

const _board = (claim: Claim, local: ReadonlyArray<Metric>): ReadonlyArray<Probe.BoardRow> => {
  const mine = HashMap.fromIterable(Array.map(local, (row) => [row.label, row] as const))
  const named = HashSet.fromIterable(Array.map(claim.metrics, (row) => row.label))
  return Array.appendAll(
    Array.map(claim.metrics, (row) => {
      const held = HashMap.get(mine, row.label)
      return {
        label: row.label,
        claimed: Option.some(row),
        local: held,
        delta: Option.flatMap(held, (near) => (near.unit === row.unit ? Option.some(near.value - row.value) : Option.none())),
      }
    }),
    Array.filterMap(local, (row) =>
      HashSet.has(named, row.label)
        ? Option.none()
        : Option.some({ label: row.label, claimed: Option.none<Metric>(), local: Option.some(row), delta: Option.none<number>() })),
  )
}
```

## [05]-[CAPTURE_FOLD]

[CAPTURE_FOLD]:
- Owner: `Probe.capture` — the capture discipline as one fold: render into a fixed-extent target (capture never reads the live swap chain — DPR and resize break determinism), await the settled frame (`compileAsync` before first capture; capture runs after the residency fold quiesces), read pixels through `renderer.readRenderTargetPixelsAsync(target, 0, 0, width, height, buffer)` (the WebGPU-safe async readback; a synchronous read stalls the pipeline and is the named defect), and delegate the octets to the mint delegate — the branch's content mint has exactly the delegation sites `core/value/contentKey` enumerates, so the delegate arrives as a parameter the composition satisfies from the runtime worker's mint site, and this module carries no hash code.
- Packages: `three` (the render-target family, the async readback — members verified against the shipped runtime); `@rasm/ts/core` (`ContentKey`, `RenderReceipt`); `effect` (`DateTime`, `Effect`, `Equal`).
- Law: capture parameters are a policy row — extent, target format, and the settle predicate live in one `as const` record; a capture with ad-hoc parameters produces an incomparable hash and is the named defect.
- Law: the comparison is structural — the local key and the receipt's key compare through `Equal.equals` on the brand; the verdict is `{ view, expected, actual, matched, at }` — a plain data row beside the wire receipt's own C#-computed `matched`/`at`, so the operator reads both proofs.
- Law: the MRT/post chain feeding a G-buffer capture is the same fold with a different target row — the WebGPU arm's `PostProcessing` pipeline with `three/tsl`'s `mrt({ … })` names the targets, and no second capture fold exists.
- Growth: hashing graduates to the GPU when readback dominates — a `typegpu` reduction kernel over the capture buffer on the scene-published device (`tgpu.initFromDevice`, `scene#BACKEND_SELECT`'s seam) feeds the same mint delegate; the delegate signature never changes, so the ladder is invisible to consumers.
- Boundary: the wire receipt's decode is the codec's; renderer and scene arrive as parameters from `scene`; verdict transport to any journal is app egress.

```typescript
import type { ContentKey, RenderReceipt } from "@rasm/ts/core"
import { DateTime, Effect, Equal } from "effect"

const _CAPTURE = { width: 1024, height: 1024 } as const

declare namespace Probe {
  type Readback = (width: number, height: number) => Effect.Effect<Uint8Array>
  type Verdict = {
    readonly view: string
    readonly expected: ContentKey
    readonly actual: ContentKey
    readonly matched: boolean
    readonly at: DateTime.Utc
  }
}

const _capture = (
  view: string,
  readback: Probe.Readback,
  mint: (octets: Uint8Array) => Effect.Effect<ContentKey>,
  receipt: RenderReceipt,
): Effect.Effect<Probe.Verdict> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const pixels = yield* readback(_CAPTURE.width, _CAPTURE.height)
    const actual = yield* mint(pixels)
    const at = yield* DateTime.now
    return {
      view,
      expected: receipt.key,
      actual,
      matched: Equal.equals(actual, receipt.key),
      at,
    }
  })
```

## [06]-[EVIDENCE_ROWS]

[EVIDENCE_ROWS]:
- Owner: `Probe.tone` — the verdict and delta presentation vocabulary: matched renders on the success tone, mismatched on the danger tone WITH both keys shown (the `:x32` spelling the kernel brand carries); delta rows tone by sign; the wire receipt's own fields render beside the local verdict; stamps format through `Format.instant`.
- Law: a mismatch is never a fault — no channel carries it, no retry fires; the verdict row IS the deliverable, and escalation is an operator decision outside this plane. Layout drift reports from `panel#LAYOUT_SOLVE` land on this same board as evidence rows under the same law.
- Law: verdict history is a bounded fold — the last N verdicts per view ride a `Chunk`-backed atom (append, take-right, the `[2]` window policy shape); evidence accumulates without unbounded memory.
- Law: evidence copies through the port — the copy-evidence affordance writes `Probe.line(row)` (one serializer over board row and verdict) through the `Clipboard` Tag (`system/primitive#CLIPBOARD_PORT`); `navigator.clipboard` in an evidence row is the named defect.
- Boundary: badge and row primitives are `system/primitive` recipes; the claim board renders `view/table` rows while metric timelines render `view/chart` series — evidence picks its surface by shape.

```typescript
import { DateTime, Option, Predicate } from "effect"

const _tone = {
  matched: { tone: "success" },
  mismatched: { tone: "danger" },
  faster: { tone: "success" },
  slower: { tone: "danger" },
  incomparable: { tone: "neutral" },
} as const

const _line = (row: Probe.BoardRow | Probe.Verdict): string =>
  Predicate.hasProperty(row, "matched")
    ? `${row.view} expected=${row.expected} actual=${row.actual} matched=${row.matched} at=${DateTime.formatIso(row.at)}`
    : [
        row.label,
        Option.match(row.claimed, { onNone: () => "claim=-", onSome: (held) => `claim=${held.value}${held.unit}` }),
        Option.match(row.local, { onNone: () => "local=-", onSome: (held) => `local=${held.value}${held.unit}` }),
        Option.match(row.delta, { onNone: () => "delta=-", onSome: (delta) => `delta=${delta}` }),
      ].join(" ")

declare namespace Probe {
  type Shape = {
    readonly window: typeof _WINDOW
    readonly extent: typeof _CAPTURE
    readonly observe: typeof _observe
    readonly rows: typeof _rows
    readonly aligned: typeof _aligned
    readonly host: typeof _host

  }
}

const Probe: Probe.Shape = {

## [07]-[RESEARCH]

- [DECK_TIMERS]-[OPEN]: which `redraw`/`update` counter member spellings the shipped `@luma.gl/engine` metrics payload carries beyond the fields the `DeckMetrics` type names; decompile the shipped `@deck.gl/core` metrics payload into `.api/deck.gl-core.md`, then fold each verified member as one `_Sums` seed field and one `_rows` entry.
- [RENDERER_INFO]-[OPEN]: whether `WebGPURenderer` carries the `WebGLRenderer.info` render/memory counter surface (`render.calls`, `render.triangles`, `memory.geometries`, `memory.textures`) under the same spelling; verify against the shipped `three/webgpu` declarations via `.api/three.md`, then land the renderer counter rows beside the deck sink as `_Sums` seed fields and `_rows` entries.
