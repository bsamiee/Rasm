description: >-
    Repairs Context7 lookups that miss: rival `/org/project` IDs and versions ranked, a
    multi-concept question split into scoped queries, an un-indexed library routed to its own
    repository. Use when a docs lookup returns the wrong library, competing ID candidates, or
    thin results — "it pulled the wrong docs", "Context7 has nothing for this". General web
    research belongs to tavily-search.

# [CONTEXT7_MCP]

Library questions resolve against live indexed documentation, never training data: `resolve-library-id` maps a library name to a Context7 ID, `query-docs` answers one scoped question against that ID. A known ID in the `/org/project` or `/org/project/version` form passes straight to `query-docs` with no resolution step.

## [01]-[FLOW]

- [RESOLVE]: `resolve-library-id` takes `libraryName` and the full question as `query` for relevance ranking.
- [SELECT]: Selection ranks by closest name match, higher benchmark score, official over forks, and a version-specific ID when the task names one.
- [QUERY]: `query-docs` takes the chosen `libraryId` and one single-concept question; a multi-concept question splits per concept, capped at three.
- [APPLY]: Fetched signatures and examples land in the answer as verified fact; the library version rides along only when it changes the guidance.

## [02]-[QUERY_SHAPE]

```text rejected
query: "auth"
```

```text accepted
libraryId: /supabase/supabase
query: "How to verify a JWT and read the authenticated user in a server-side route"
```

Specific, task-shaped queries return targeted sections; bare keywords return noise. Passing the user's own phrasing whole outperforms a paraphrase.

## [03]-[FALLBACK]

A library or version absent from the index routes to its own repository or documentation site through tavily-search — never to memory.
