# [TOPOLOGY]

Draw which deployable units run where and reach each other over what path. The template bakes in the topology discipline an unassisted attempt scatters — groups are real zones, every edge is reachability over a real port pair, and the fcose grid is earned by constraint: edge ports (`L|R|T|B`) match the reading direction and every rank aligns both ways through `align row|column`, which is what produces orthogonal edges instead of diagonal drift. Use `architecture-beta` with 2-4 groups, 4-7 services, ports on every edge, and `architecture.seed` as the deterministic lock. Arrowheads fill from `archEdgeArrowColor` — unset they render grey — the built-in icon plates re-fill through the service and group rect stamps (service and group icons hardcode the same blue plate), group titles take the Lavender container-title stamp through `.architecture-groups text`, and arrow size rides `iconSize` because a CSS transform on the arrow polygons erases their placement. Junctions join genuinely multi-way edges only — on a two-way hop the junction misplaces its arrow. Logical components drawn as services are the defect; this archetype holds deployables.

Refill by renaming zones and services to the real deployment, keep a port pair on every edge, and re-derive the `align` grid whenever a service lands — every row and column of the intended grid is declared, because the constraint set is the layout. The pink polygon arrows, Selection icon plates, and Lavender dashed group walls are fixed law — a refill renames the fleet, never strips the fidelity surface.
