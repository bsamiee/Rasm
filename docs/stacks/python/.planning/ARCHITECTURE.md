# [PYTHON_STACK_ARCHITECTURE]

This planning architecture records `docs/stacks/python/` as the Python stack documentation topology. The codemap lists current files, the planned view keeps uncreated concept pages and spec sheets out of current truth, and [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) owns sequence and task status.

```

Planned files appear only in `Planned view` until created.

## [2]-[SCOPE_BOUNDARY]

Included: `docs/stacks/python/`, its README chooser, leaf overlay, language decision page, PEP standards page, scope-local report companion, and scope-local planning files.

Excluded: Python source implementation, exact package version tables, generated outputs, runtime validation logs, report source material as doctrine, and durable coding doctrine after concept pages exist.

Adjacent routes: `pyproject.toml` carries current Python package and tool graph truth until the platform route exists; `docs/stacks/AGENTS.md` carries stack-parent topology; `docs/standards/` carries documentation form.

Reader rule: edits under `docs/stacks/python/` must keep the README chooser, leaf overlay, roadmap, and planned architecture aligned.

## [3]-[PROJECT_IDENTITY]

Package or export surface: not applicable; this scope is documentation, not a Python package.

Build target: none owned here.

Generated outputs: none owned here.

## [4]-[CONTRACTS_GENERATED_TRUTH]

This scope owns no generated contract. If a future Python stack page represents generated output or parser-owned Markdown, route generated-truth fields to the relevant concept page and keep generator mechanics out of this planning architecture.

## [5]-[ENTRYPOINTS_AND_FLOWS]

| [INDEX] | [ENTRYPOINT]                            | [KIND]       | [NEXT]       |
| :-----: | :-------------------------------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
|   [1]   | `README.md`                             | chooser      | concept page |

|   [6]   | `.planning/SPEC.aot-first-decorator.md` | spec sheet   | future owner |

[ENTRYPOINT_EFFECTS]:
- Entrypoint: `README.md`
  - Input: Python stack decision.
  - Effect: routes reader action to the owning page.
- Entrypoint: `AGENTS.md`
  - Input: Python stack edit.
  - Effect: changes maintenance behavior for this folder.
- Entrypoint: `.reports/AGENTS.md`
  - Input: reusable Python stack research session.
  - Effect: keeps report mechanics source-material-only and promotes final guidance to a planning spec sheet.
- Entrypoint: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
  - Input: planned stack buildout.
  - Effect: preserves sequence and task status.
- Entrypoint: `.planning/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - Input: planned topology.
  - Effect: separates active files from planned promotion paths.
- Entrypoint: `.planning/SPEC.aot-first-decorator.md`
  - Input: AOT-first planning detail.
  - Effect: remains source material until referenced rules land.

The README chooser selects the concept page for the coding decision and uses the roadmap only when the concept page is planned but not yet promoted. The AGENTS overlay changes maintenance behavior for this folder; it does not carry language rules, package graph state, roadmap task bodies, report mechanics, or architecture codemap.

## [6]-[DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION]

Stack concept pages may consume `pyproject.toml`, source, generated contracts, maintained Python documentation, and trusted instruction overlays as proof. Current graph facts flow from manifests into platform or concept owners; target capability stays in the concept page that owns the decision.

Allowed direction:

    accTitle: Python stack dependency direction
    accDescr: The Python stack overlay routes edits to the README chooser, roadmap, and report companion; report sessions promote into planning spec sheets; architecture and roadmap synchronize planning state; concept owners feed later testing and platform routes; and planned labels stay out of the current codemap until files exist.

    Platform -. "no core ownership" .-> Concepts
```

Text equivalent: `AGENTS.md` changes maintenance routing toward the README chooser, roadmap, and report companion; `.reports/AGENTS.md` keeps research source-material-only and promotes final guidance to planning spec sheets; `.planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.planning/ROADMAP.md` keep topology and sequence synchronized; planning spec sheets feed future concept owners; core concept pages feed testing in M-0020 and platform in M-0030; testing and platform routes must not own core concept doctrine; planned labels enter the current codemap only after their files exist.

## [7]-[INVARIANTS]

[CORE_FLATNESS]:
- Rule: core Python coding doctrine stays in flat root concept pages.
- Forbids: category folders for core value, surface, rail, boundary, runtime, or algorithm pages before multiple peer leaves need a chooser.
- Check: M-0010 planned structure has root files only.

[TESTING_FOLDER_GATE]:
- Rule: testing becomes a folder only in M-0020.
- Forbids: putting proof-tool decisions into core concept pages or platform package pages.
- Check: `testing/README.md` appears after M-0010 in the roadmap.

[PLATFORM_FOLDER_GATE]:
- Rule: platform becomes a folder only in M-0030.
- Forbids: package graph, tool graph, and build truth leaking into core coding doctrine.
- Check: `platform/README.md` and `platform/build-and-packages.md` appear after testing in the roadmap.

[PLANNING_TOPOLOGY]:
- Rule: planned files stay out of the current codemap until they exist.
- Forbids: treating planned concept pages as current paths or durable doctrine.
- Check: codemap lists only files present under `docs/stacks/python/`.

[PROMOTION_MODEL]:
- Rule: promote planned files only after the active roadmap task reaches them.
- Forbids: moving rule bodies into planning once an active owner exists.
- Check: README chooser links current pages, and planned-view records close when promoted.

[OWNER_SHAPE]:
- Rule: concept pages are named by domain, category, or concept, not external libraries.
- Forbids: package-specific pages, helper taxonomies, and skill-shaped documentation buckets.
- Check: planned owners use concept-page names and keep package, tool, and proof claims in platform or testing routes.

[EXAMPLE_SHAPE]:
- Rule: examples stay dense, neutral, and multi-law.
- Forbids: single-feature snippets that train surface-level adoption.
- Check: promoted concept pages carry example bodies only under the owning concept.

## [8]-[STATUS_AND_ROADMAP]

[ROADMAP_RELATION]:
- Changed fact: `.planning/ROADMAP.md` milestone sequencing and task status.
- Consumed by: `Planned view`, `Dependency direction`, and `Invariants`.
- Use in this document: planned pages become current only when roadmap tasks promote them and README links them.
- Update when: task status, planned filename, owner scope, promotion target, folder gate, or README chooser row changes.
- Close when: all planned pages are current and no planned route changes agent action.
- Route-away: task order, progress, dependencies, and task exit proof stay in [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

Current status: seed files are the active buildout surface. Planned concept pages become current only when created and linked from the README chooser.

## [10]-[PROOF]

Representation: codemap.
Evidence: repository path inspection of `docs/stacks/python/` and current planning files.
Generated from: manual path review.
Controlling source: repository paths, README chooser, roadmap, and planning spec.
Last verified: 2026-06-08.
Review trigger: path, planned filename, README chooser row, roadmap task, planning spec, testing folder gate, or platform folder gate changes.
Element match: codemap nodes map to files present under `docs/stacks/python/`.
Result: current codemap lists active files, and planned files remain in `Planned view`.

Proof gap: planned spec sheets plus planned core, testing, and platform pages do not exist yet; the roadmap owns their execution sequence.

## [11]-[BOUNDARIES]

Architecture carries current and planned topology. Roadmap carries task order and progress. README carries reader orientation. AGENTS carries local maintenance behavior. `.reports/AGENTS.md` carries source-material mechanics. Spec sheets carry task-ready synthesis until promoted. Concept pages carry coding decisions. Testing pages carry proof decisions. Platform pages carry package graph and build truth.

Do not preserve this planning architecture as current structure after the planned pages become ordinary docs.

## [12]-[VALIDATION]

- [ ] Codemap lists only current paths.
- [ ] Report source material stays out of current doctrine, roadmap progress, and concept-page ownership.
- [ ] Planned spec sheets appear only in `Planned view` until created.
- [ ] Planned core pages appear only in `Planned view`.
- [ ] Planned testing folder appears only in M-0020 planned topology until created.
- [ ] Planned platform folder appears only in M-0030 planned topology until created.
- [ ] Every planned path has a promotion target and removal trigger.
- [ ] README chooser, roadmap, and planned architecture agree.
- [ ] No core planned page is named after an external library.
