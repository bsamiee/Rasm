# [PY_ARTIFACTS_RECEIPT]

`ArtifactReceipt` is the one kind-discriminated artifact-evidence family every production sub-domain mints a case onto — one `@tagged_union(frozen=True)` keyed by the runtime `ContentKey`, satisfying the runtime `receipts.ReceiptContributor` port through `contribute`. Each case is a `(ContentKey, <facts>)` payload of native scalars called positionally; byte-only kinds are a bare pair, evidence-rich kinds close on one `frozendict` band as the LAST slot. `_BAND` assigns each banded kind its namespace, `_facts` projects every band entry as `<namespace>.<fact>`, and every fixed fact name derives dot-free from its mint signature, so a band fact can never shadow canonical evidence or the reserved `"artifact"` discriminant. Case roster is the ONE derivation owner — a load gate pins the `ArtifactKind` spelling, the fact-name table derives from the mint signatures — so the receipt stream stays one fact family the planner, the reuse-fabric elision, and the runtime `Metrics` projection read off one `contribute` fold, never a parallel rail per producer.

`ConformanceVerdict` is DECLARED ON THIS PAGE: `exchange/conformance` imports it DOWN and mints it, `delivery/transmittal` and `exchange/credential` read it off the receipt seam. `contribute` projects the active payload onto the runtime receipt spine, records byte-volume and compression-ratio through `Metrics.record(domain="artifact", kind=...)`, and fires the `core/hooks#POINTS` emitted tap at the same fold — the measured-signals and production-fact seam, never a local metrics fief or a parallel fact family. A failed production is never an artifacts case — the producer's runtime `boundary` converts the raise into the `BoundaryFault` the spine's `rejected` line carries. `graduates` projects any receipt onto the compute graduation hub's artifacts-origin case, the one outward figure hand-off.

## [01]-[INDEX]

- [01]-[RECEIPT]: the kind-discriminated artifact-evidence union over native-scalar `case()` payloads, its roster-derived `_CASES`/`_KEYS`/`_BAND` owner, the `contribute` projection onto the runtime spine, and the `graduates` outward hand-off.
- [02]-[SIGNALS]: the receipt-fold consumer seams, the outward figure hand-off, and the span-coverage charter.

## [02]-[RECEIPT]

- Owner: `ArtifactReceipt` is one `@tagged_union(frozen=True)` keyed by the `ArtifactKind` discriminant, every case a `tuple[ContentKey, ...]` whose first slot is the shared `ContentKey` and whose remaining slots are the producer's named scalars, the evidence-rich `preview`/`color`/`media`/`cad`/`scene`/`office`/`document` kinds closing on one `frozendict` band as their last slot. It satisfies the structural `receipts.ReceiptContributor` Protocol through `contribute`, and the union imports NO producer module — every case carries native scalars, the local `ConformanceVerdict`, or a `frozendict` band, so no `c2pa-python`/`av`/`pysubs2`/`pikepdf` surface crosses in.
- Cases: the case-shape rulings the fence tuples cannot show — `Office`/`Report`/`Document` share the `(key, bytes_)` head but split by producer origin (a workbook/slide container, a composed report, and the generic `typography` document-rail blob for an axis catalog, glyph run, or line-broken stream that is neither a PDF nor an office file), `Office` and `Document` closing on a defaulted `facts` band (`finish`/`product` namespaces) while `Report` stays byte-only; `Egress` is reused by `document/tagged#ACCESS`, which maps its structural element count onto `outline_depth` and figure count onto `overlays` rather than declaring a parallel access case; `Schedule` is a distinct AEC case beside `Table` because a schedule carries its NCS/AIA kind and item cardinality the generic publication `Table` does not; `Cad` is distinct because a DXF document carries version/units/salvage-auditor evidence no publication case holds; `Drawing` is ONE shared case across the drawing plane (`dimension`/`annotate`/`symbol`/`detail`), its `style` a neutral slot each producer fills, never a per-producer rail; the delivery pair `Register`/`Transmittal` are admitted as CASES beside `Spec`/`Drawing`/`Schedule`, never a parallel delivery-receipt rail; and the seven banded kinds close on a `frozendict` band so a heterogeneous per-producer fact set rides one case — `Preview` absorbs BOTH the perceptual float band and the machine-readable-mark string facts under one `float | str` union, and `Media` folds every media page's `av`/`pysubs2` evidence onto its band rather than a fixed-scalar bag whose subtitle/loudness/scene fields default to zero on the pages that never produce them. `Preview` and `Color` require a fixed `bytes_` slot so every raster and separation artifact records byte volume through the `_METRIC` fold rather than smuggling a `bytes` band fact past it or defaulting absent evidence to zero. Each mint is a `@classmethod` returning `Self`, binding the subtype once where a `@staticmethod`-plus-forward-ref re-spells the return type on every mint, and stays thin — keyword-constructing its `case()` and adding nothing — while the optional `scores`/`facts` bands and `Media.bit_rate` keep a band-free or unknown-rate encode valid.
- Bands: the band is a declared grammar, never an open bag — two band kinds exist and each is lawful on its own axis. A FACT band (`preview`/`color`/`media`/`scene`/`office`/`document`) carries producer-owned measurement vocabulary (the `graphic/raster/measure` transform scores, `graphic/color/managed`'s `ManagedFact` rows, the media loudness/scene facts, the office finishing and typography product facts) whose leaf names live at the producer that measures them; a DOMAIN-KEYED table (`cad` `counts`) carries domain names as keys — the uppercase DXF entity spellings — never fact names. Both project through the kind's `_BAND` namespace (`score.`/`ink.`/`stream.`/`view.`/`entity.`/`finish.`/`product.`), so a band entry is self-describing in the `EventDict`, cannot shadow a fixed fact (fixed names are dot-free by the load gate), and cannot emit the reserved `"artifact"` key. A band fact that graduates to a governed metric or ceiling first graduates to a FIXED slot on its case — the `bytes_` promotion is the precedent — so `_METRIC` and `_CEILING` read only declared fixed names.
- Entry: `contribute(self)` returns the one-element `Iterable[Receipt]` the port declares, appending the `ArtifactKind` discriminant under the reserved `"artifact"` key — reserved because `contribute` overwrites it last, so no `_facts` arm may emit it, and the inner `"kind"` fact the `diagram`/`schedule`/`register` cases carry and the `cad` DXF output format that rides `"format"` each stay distinct. At the same fold the measured-signals seam fires: every `_METRIC`-named numeric fact records through `Metrics.record(domain="artifact", kind=self.tag)`, a kind carrying no `_METRIC` fact recording nothing. It takes NO `phase` parameter — an `ArtifactReceipt` is by construction the evidence of an EMITTED artifact, so the phase is the constant `"emitted"` and a parameter is a knob the value already answers. That same fold fires the production-fact tap through `Production.fired` — every kind fires `ReceiptEmitted` under `rasm.artifacts.receipt.emitted`, and the `transmittal` kind fires its case scalars as `TransmittalIssued` under `rasm.artifacts.delivery.issued` — each payload the receipt's own projection carrying the `scoped` issue-baggage correlation id, so audit subscription rides the hook registry and no producer page fires a fact of its own.
- Auto: `slot` is the `ContentKey` head every case shares, bound through one total `match self` whose or-pattern captures `(key, *_)` once and closes on `assert_never`, where a reflective `getattr(self, self.tag)[0]` erases the key to `object` and defeats the exhaustiveness witness the planner keys on. `_facts` is the second total `match self`, three arms total: `verdict` spreads the local `ConformanceVerdict.facts()`, the ONE banded or-pattern destructures `(_key, *tail, band)` and joins the mint-derived fixed zip with the namespaced band spread, and the flat or-pattern zips each scalar tail against `_KEYS[self.tag]` under `strict=True`, keeping native ints/floats intact. Roster stays the ONE derivation owner: `_CASES` reads the case fields through `annotationlib.get_annotations` over the union, the first load gate raises at import when the `ArtifactKind` Literal and the roster drift, `_KEYS` derives every fact tail — banded kinds dropping the trailing band parameter — from its mint signature under the `removesuffix("_")` builtin-collision rule, and the second load gate raises when any fixed fact name — a mint-derived row or a spread `ConformanceVerdict` field off `structs.fields` — carries a dot or spells the reserved `"artifact"` — one declaration site, so renaming a mint parameter renames the emitted fact and an unlawful name breaks at import, never at a fold.
- Output: `graduates(self, *, ceiling=None)` is the one outward figure hand-off — it projects ANY receipt onto the compute graduation hub's artifacts-origin case, keyed by the receipt's own `slot` with no re-mint, `measured` the numeric `_facts` ledger (every `int`/`float` including namespaced band floats, `bool` excluded — the verdict flags are admission facts, not residuals) and `bars` the kind-scoped `_CEILING` row combined by pointwise minimum with the caller's tighter per-key override. Admission, the `content.graduate` span, and the `planned`-receipt egress stay compute's — this page composes the hub DOWNWARD and adds no second fence, span, or re-wrap, since a second `@receipted` over the returned rail double-streams the receipt. A `_CEILING` row names only fixed facts its keyed kind measures: `color` bars `tac_peak` at `320.0`, `cad` bars `errors` at `0.0`, and an ungoverned kind supplies no inherited bar; `model_asset` is a compute-own subject figures never ride, and the projection re-mints no canonical concept.
- Packages: `expression` (`tagged_union`/`tag`/`case` the union, `Map` the derived `_KEYS`/`_METRIC`/`_CEILING` tables); `msgspec` (`Struct` + `structs.asdict` the re-homed `ConformanceVerdict`); the builtin `frozendict` (the case evidence bands and the `_BAND` namespace rows — msgspec-native and hashable where `Map` is not); stdlib `annotationlib.get_annotations` + `inspect.signature` (the `_CASES` roster and `_KEYS` mint-signature derivations); `opentelemetry-api` (`context.get_current` feeding the `scoped` baggage read); core hooks (`Production`/`ArtifactHook` and the `ReceiptEmitted`/`TransmittalIssued` projections, the floor sibling); runtime (`identity.ContentKey`, `receipts.Receipt` and the structurally-satisfied `ReceiptContributor` port, `metrics.Metrics.record` the domain/kind arm, `faults.RuntimeRail`); compute (`graduation.handoff.GraduationReceipt`/`HandoffAxis`, imported downward). No producer module crosses in.
- Growth: a new artifact kind is one `ArtifactKind` token, one `case()`, one `@classmethod` mint, one `slot` or-pattern arm, and one `_facts` or-pattern alternative — the load gates and the `assert_never` tails break at import until every piece exists. A flat kind adds nothing else (its `_KEYS` row derives from the mint signature); a banded kind adds its `_BAND` namespace row, so a new band fact is one key the producer fills with zero receipt edit and the namespace projection lands it lawfully. A new scalar on a flat or banded kind is one slot on its `case()` and one mint parameter, the `strict=True` zip raising on drift; a new measured signal is one FIXED slot with one `_METRIC` row here and one `InstrumentSpec` row on the runtime metrics owner; a new governed residual bar is one `_CEILING` row over a fixed fact the barred kinds measure.
- Boundary: one union carries every domain's evidence as a case, never a per-type `DocumentReceipt`/`PdfReceipt`/`MediaReceipt` family or a parallel `ColorReceipt`/AEC/delivery rail beside it, and never a per-kind evidence `Struct` re-wrapping scalars the producer passes positionally; the `media` band carries each page's own evidence, never a monolithic fixed-scalar case defaulting the absent pages to zero. `_KEYS`, `_BAND`, and `ArtifactKind` derive from or pin to the roster, never a hand-synced parallel table; a band entry projects only under its kind's namespace, never spread bare where it stamps over a fixed fact; `ConformanceVerdict` is re-homed DOWN, never imported upward into the spine. Metrics route through `Metrics.record`, never a page-owned histogram/counter/logging fief, and no render DURATION fact rides a case — the runtime metrics aspect owns timing. Facts reach the `dict[str, object]` `EventDict` as native scalars, never `str()`-pre-formatted; `slot`/`_facts` read through the total `match`, never a reflective `getattr`; `contribute` carries no `phase` parameter and no artifacts-side `rejected` forwarder; `graduates` adds no second `@receipted` re-wrap; and the union imports no producer module.

## [03]-[SIGNALS]

- [REUSE_ELISION]: reuse-fabric leg is the receipt-fold CONSUMER of the runtime `execution/lanes#LANE` `(ContentKey, Work)` admission elision. Artifacts holds the consumer edge: every producer mints its key over the INPUT spec pre-run, threads it into the lane admission, and `_emit` threads it into the terminal receipt so `slot` reads it back for the hit/miss distinction — no new case, no new owner, no re-minted key.
- [METRIC_SIGNALS]: measured-signal leg is COMPOSED at the `contribute` fold — the `_METRIC` rows project the present numeric facts onto `Metrics.record(domain="artifact", kind=...)`, keyed by the carried kind, so per-kind size/ratio distributions route off one stream with zero artifacts-local metric state. Render DURATION is NOT a receipt fact — the runtime metrics aspect times the serve coroutine — and a new upstream `domain="artifact"` instrument is one `_METRIC` row here. Attribution dimensions are runtime-owned: the `rasm.tenant` baggage entry the `core/issue#ISSUE` bracket binds folds onto every `Metrics.record` arm through the metrics owner's `_attributed`, so no tenant or issue attribute row lands here — the per-call issue scope stays a log/baggage dimension, never a metric attribute, by cardinality law.
- [HOOK_TAPS]: production-fact leg fires at the same fold — `Production.fired` streams the `ReceiptEmitted` projection for every kind and the `TransmittalIssued` projection for the `transmittal` kind, so audit, veto, and replay consumers subscribe at the app root through the `core/hooks#POINTS` registry and the receipt stream stays the one evidence truth the fired fact projects.
- [PLAN_FABRIC]: production-planning leg is the third receipt-fold CONSUMER — `core/plan#PLAN` reads each producer's resolved `ArtifactReceipt` as the content-keyed evidence its sub-graph elision distinguishes a hit from a miss on. `planned`-stage observability is the planner's OWN direct `Receipt.of` emit, so the `admitted`/`planned`/`emitted` line family is shared by that emit and the producers' `emitted` facts, never a phase threaded through `contribute`.
- [FIGURE_HANDOFF]: outward figure edge to a sibling package travels the compute `graduation/handoff#GRADUATION` rail on its artifacts-origin `artifact` case. `graduates` projects any receipt — the axis subject the `ArtifactKind` tag, the evidence key the receipt's own `slot`, the measured ledger the numeric `_facts` scalars, the ceiling the governed `_CEILING`. `model_asset` is a compute-own subject figures never ride, and the returned rail is compute's own egress, never re-wrapped here.
- [SPAN_POLICY]: span coverage is charter, never a per-page choice — a producer opens exactly ONE OpenTelemetry span when its render crosses the runtime lane onto a foreign native kernel whose interior stages the lane aspect cannot attribute, and every other producer emits receipts and the `_METRIC` projection with no span, because the runtime lane and serve weaves already own their timing.
- [SPAN_CLASS]: `typography/layout`, `typography/shape`, and `visualization/chart/export` are the native-offload class — each gains its span at the offload site, and the span/log handles resolve the runtime-configured pipeline, so no artifacts-side tracer or logging configuration exists.
- [SPAN_ERROR]: every offload rail folds INSIDE the span scope — the Error arm sets `Status(StatusCode.ERROR)` and emits the structured error log from `fault.facts()` before the span closes, so a failed render never exits an `UNSET` span or an uncorrelated log. Attribution arrives ambient: the error line inherits the issue-scope key through the runtime `merge_contextvars` head, tenant lands through the runtime `PROMOTED_BAGGAGE` log promotion, and a producer page binding either re-owns a runtime seam.
- [SPAN_EXCEPTION]: `Span.record_exception` and the `dict_tracebacks` expansion are void at this seam — the lane rail carries the typed `BoundaryFault`, the live raise converted at the runtime `boundary` and unpicklable across the worker crossing, so the flat `facts()` projection is the whole error evidence.
- [SPAN_STAGE]: a producer whose span brackets more than one lane crossing marks each stage boundary with `Span.add_event` — the chart export's pre-pass is that class; a single-crossing producer carries no stage events, its worker interior unattributable by charter.
