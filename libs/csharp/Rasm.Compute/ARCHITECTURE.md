# [RASM_COMPUTE_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `Rasm.Compute` — the APP-PLATFORM measured-execution package. One intent rail admits work once at the boundary, one substrate axis routes it over row data, bounded lanes carry it, and one `ComputeReceipt` union records every outcome across the Tensor, Symbolic, Model, Solver, Stats, Runtime, and Analysis folders.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, lowercase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

Implementation collapses to one owner per axis and one entrypoint family per rail: a new feature is a row or case on a budgeted owner, and a public type outside an owner region is the named defect. The rail is named in the return type — `Fin<T>` aborts at admission, `Validation<Error,T>` accumulates (the monoidal `Error` carrier; typed `ComputeFault` arms lift onto it through their `Expected` base, since `ComputeFault` is not itself a monoid), `IO<T>` carries effects, `Option<T>` carries absence. The `ComputeFault` union projects through `FaultDetail` at the wire edge; receipts stamp NodaTime `Instant`/`Duration`, and AppHost `ClockPolicy` owns both clocks.

`ComputeIntent` admits through `IntentAdmission` into an `AdmittedIntent`; `SubstrateSelection` folds over substrate rows and lands a `SelectionReceipt`; `LaneRuntime` enqueues onto bounded lanes and pumps into `DispatchTable`, which routes to `TensorOps`, `ModelSessions`, or `WireChannels`; every lane emits `ComputeReceipt` cases through `ReceiptSinkPort`, admission and selection failures land on `ComputeFault`, and `ProgressCell` delivers cadence-gated marks to UI and wire observers.

## [04]-[SEAM_PROHIBITIONS]

The cross-folder seam invariants every Compute owner checks itself against before crossing a strata or runtime boundary. A seam that violates a row is the named defect this block owns.

| [INDEX] | [SEAM] | [INVARIANT] | [REJECTED_FORM] |
| :-----: | ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| [01] | device residency | The `Substrate.DeviceWgpu` row binds the AppUi-owned `ONE_WGPU_DEVICE` `Device`/`Queue`; Compute mints no second device and holds the compute-only resources only. | A second `Device`/`Queue` acquisition inside the Compute lane; a parallel device-residency lattice beside `OrtResidency.DeviceResident`. |
| [02] | host-neutral lane | A host geometry type never enters a lane signature; host geometry folds inside the kernel `Rasm.Drawing` (`Encode.Apply`) and the `Rasm.AppHost` `GeometryPacking` sandbox capsule, and `Tensor/residency` consumes only the host-neutral `EncodedGeometry` float payload (wrapped as `EncodedTensor`), naming no host geometry type. | A `RhinoCommon`/host type on an interior `Tensor`/`Solve`/`Estimator` signature; a residency-side `GeometryPacking`/`GeometryEncoding` re-packer over host geometry coordinates. |
| [03] | bSDD / ifctester / tessellation | Compute owns the channel and the companion-rpc orchestration; Bim owns the response/IDS/semantic projection and the `LocalShape` degrade. | A Compute-side bSDD response projection, IDS parser, or IFC semantic read; a Bim-minted transport. |
| [04] | units ingress | `Symbolic/units` owns the `QuantityFamily` SI-canonicalization for Compute-internal admission and the host-free peers (Python/TypeScript) decode the canonicalized scalar over the wire. The AEC-domain folders (`Rasm.Materials`, `Rasm.Fabrication`) admit `UnitsNet` IN-FOLDER at their own boundary — `Rasm.Fabrication/Process` at `RemovalParameter.Admit`, `Rasm.Materials/Appearance` photometric at its own admission — because the strata graph is acyclic (app-platform consumes AEC-domain, never the reverse). | A `Rasm.Compute` PROJECT REFERENCE from an AEC-domain folder to read this units owner — the forbidden AEC→app-platform downward edge; a Compute page asserting an AEC consumer reads its units export over a reference. |
| [05] | least-squares / spectral | `Tensor/blas` owns `LevenbergMarquardt`/thin-QR and `Model/inference` owns the ONNX spectral run for Compute-internal solves and the host-free graduation/inference peers. The AEC-domain `Rasm.Materials` BRDF fit and spectral grounding stay IN-FOLDER (the `FitRoughness` heuristic, the in-folder `SpectralUpsample`); the algorithms-doc thin-QR fit is a doctrine reference the Materials probe cites, never a Compute project reference. | A `Rasm.Compute` PROJECT REFERENCE or a "MathNet transitive via Rasm.Compute" claim from `Rasm.Materials` — the forbidden AEC→app-platform downward edge; a Compute page asserting the Materials fit reads its solver over a reference. |
| [06] | graduation evidence | Offline-learned models (deep training, learned input distributions, PCE/neural-field surrogates, residual predictors) are the Python companion's, decoded by content key over `ONE_GRADUATION_EVIDENCE`; C# owns inference plus classical fit. | An in-proc deep-training or distribution-learning loop in C#. |
| [07] | analysis graph read | The `Analysis` rail reads the CONCRETE `Rasm.Element` `ElementGraph` upward (the shared lower stratum, same shape as the kernel reference) and writes a content-keyed `Node.Assessment` `GraphDelta` the caller applies; it never goes through `IElementProjection` (the AEC-domain projector seam) and never references the AEC-domain peers — alignment travels through the seam graph, not a sibling project reference. | An `Analysis` `IElementProjection` implementation; a `Rasm.Compute`→`Rasm.Materials`/`Rasm.Bim` project reference; a Compute-side graph mutation in place instead of a `GraphDelta` the seam applies. |
| [08] | energy toolchain | `EnergyToolchain` resolves EnergyPlus by env var, configured path, or bundle; `EnergyRoute` converges local and cloud runs on `SqlFile`. | Hardcoded path; shipped Forge dependency; parallel runner; token column on `EnergyPolicy`. |
| [09] | closed-form + aggregator ownership | Closed-form ISO/EN physics (the thermal/acoustic/fire folds) and the multi-ply `AssemblyAggregator` (ISO 6946 series-U / ISO 12354 layered-STC / rule-of-mixtures / GWP / cost) live in `Analysis`, never the seam; the single-material PURE acoustic folds (`Nrc`/`Saa`/`StcWeighted`) and the `RatingContour` `Stc.Fit`/`Rw.Fit` contour kernel stay seam-owned, and `Analysis` composes them. | A closed-form ISO/EN fold in `Rasm.Element`; a second `AssemblyAggregator` retained in `Rasm.Materials`; a second contour-fit algorithm beside the seam `RatingContour.Fit` kernel; design-code rules as imperative arms instead of the `DesignCode`×`LimitState` capacity table. |

## [05]-[PROHIBITIONS]

The authoritative prohibition set on the package spine that every new owner row checks itself against: one enumerated invariant set with code-band custody. Every device/sparse/autodiff/stats/UQ/optimizer capability is a row or case on an existing owner, never a sibling owner or a second state machine.

| [INDEX] | [PROHIBITION] | [CANONICAL_OWNER] | [PAGE] |
| :-----: | ------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| [01] | No package-local tensor wrapper / `TensorService` beside `System.Numerics.Tensors` `Tensor<T>`; no `DeviceTensor`/`GpuTensor` parallel type (device-ness is the `OrtResidency.DeviceResident` discriminant); no second `OrtIoBinding` steady-state capsule beside `Tensor/residency` `BoundFlow`, which `Model/inference` composes for its run-mode fold and which `TensorBridge` is the sole `OrtValue` C-data factory for. | `Tensor<T>` + span views; `OrtResidency`/`BoundFlow`/`TensorBridge` | `Tensor/vocabulary`, `Tensor/residency` |
| [02] | No hand-rolled BLAS/factorization beside the MathNet `LinearProvider` stack and CSparse direct factors; no `RasmMatrix`/`DenseMatrix` wrapper; no hand-rolled FFT/SVD/normal-equations/LM loop. | `LinearProvider`/`DenseOps`/`LevenbergMarquardt`; `SparseOps`/`SparseTensorOps` | `Tensor/blas`, `Tensor/factor` |
| [03] | Symbolic/device/learning/constitutive faults extend the `ComputeFault` 2200 band at the next-free code (the Symbolic lane owns 2213..2216, the analysis lane 2217..2219, and the scheduling lane 2220, so a new fault enters at 2221+), never a parallel fault union or a status-code-plus-string terminal — every fault crosses the wire through the one `FaultDetail` family. | `ComputeFault` (`Runtime/admission`) | `Runtime/admission`, `Runtime/wire` |
| [04] | No string-eval in the solver/optimizer/UQ/constitutive `evaluate` oracle — the `Func<DesignPoint, Fin<Seq<double>>>` contract is the only coupling point; an OR-Tools `CpModel` builds through the typed model-builder API, never a string-parsed model. | `evaluate` oracle (`Solver/optimizer`, `Solver/uncertainty`) | `Solver/optimizer`, `Solver/uncertainty`, `Solver/contract` |
| [05] | One `HybridCache` per lane, no per-call cache instance; one shared session per model identity. | lane custody (`Runtime/scheduling`) | `Runtime/scheduling`, `Model/sessions` |
| [06] | Every new accelerator/sparse/AD/estimator/optimizer/UQ capability is a row or case on an existing owner (a `Substrate` row, a `SparseTensorOpFamily` row, a `DifferentiableOp`+`Forward` pair, an `EstimatorKind` row, an `OptimizerKind` row, an `UncertaintyMethod` row, a `ConstitutiveModel` case), never a sibling owner or a second admission spine. | the budgeted owner blocks | all `.planning/**` |
| [07] | The assessment outcome is one `ComputeReceipt.Assessment` case (declared as a `partial` on the `Runtime/receipts` owner, registered there as the `[JsonDerivedType]` row + wire projection) and the discipline faults extend the one `ComputeFault` 2200 band at `2217+` (`AssessmentInputMissing` 2217 / `ToolchainUnresolved` 2218 / `AnalysisFailed` 2219, above the Symbolic lane's 2213..2216), never a parallel assessment receipt or fault union; every discipline runner reads the concrete `ElementGraph` and returns the ONE uniform `AssessmentResult` fact stream, never a parallel per-discipline result family; design codes are a `DesignCode`×`LimitState` capacity table, never imperative per-code arms. | `Analysis` rail (`Assessment`) | `Analysis/**` |

The `ComputeFault` 2200 band is custodied by the `Runtime/admission` owner and runs in four lanes declared as partials on that one owner: the core `Text` 2200 .. `CacheCorrupt` 2212 (`Runtime/admission`), the Symbolic lane 2213 .. 2216 (`Symbolic/expression`'s `SymbolicFault` — `ParseRejected` 2213 / `SymbolUndefined` 2214 / `NonDifferentiable` 2215 — plus `Symbolic/dimensional`'s `DimensionMismatch` 2216), and the analysis lane `AssessmentInputMissing` 2217 / `ToolchainUnresolved` 2218 / `AnalysisFailed` 2219 — the typed `(SolvePhase, FailureKind, Detail, Option<int> Code)` case (`Analysis/assessment`), and the scheduling lane `GraphCyclic` 2220 (`Runtime/scheduling`), so the next-free code is 2221 — a symbolic/device/learning/constitutive/assessment fault row enters at 2221+ and never collides with an existing code; the EC3 boundary reuses `EndpointUnreachable` 2208 rather than minting a new carbon-band code; the `HybridCache`-per-lane clause aligns with the `Runtime/scheduling` lane custody and the no-parallel-fault clause aligns with the `Runtime/wire` `FaultDetail` projection (the band-complete `FaultWire` rail whose `Bands` registry mirrors the custody map, plus Compute's SECOND custody — the Remote `WireFault` 4520..4532 sub-band pinned reciprocally in the AppHost/AppUi/Persistence registries) so device/symbolic/assessment faults still cross the wire through the one family, and the `Analysis` assessment outcome rides the one `ComputeReceipt.Assessment` case the `Runtime/receipts` union owns (registered there as the `[JsonDerivedType]` row + wire projection, declared there as a partial by `Analysis/assessment`).
