# [RASM_APPHOST_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `Rasm.AppHost` — the APP-PLATFORM runtime spine. One domain-folder owner per concern with closed cases, every entrypoint a typed rail, and every cross-package fact crossing the inward port records across the Runtime, Agent, Wire, Sandbox, and Observability folders.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, lowercase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

Implementation collapses to one owner per axis and one entrypoint family per rail: a new feature is a row or case on a budgeted owner, and a public type outside an owner region is the named defect. The rail is named in the return type — `Validation<E,T>` accumulates, `Fin<T>` aborts, `IO<T>` carries effects; receipts stamp NodaTime `Instant`/`Duration`, and `TimeProvider` owns elapsed measurement.

    accTitle: AppHost boot-to-drain spine
    accDescr: Profile resolution feeds host boot, configuration, composition, and the lifecycle cell; runtime rails surround Running; the drain conductor folds participants into one unload receipt.
    Resolve["ProfileSurface.Resolve"] --> Boot["ProfileBoot.Boot"]
    Boot --> Compose["ConfigSource.Compose"]

```

`ProfileSurface.Resolve` materializes the one `ResolvedProfile` record, `ProfileBoot.Boot` configures the Generic Host builder, `ConfigSource.Compose` mounts the ranked source chain, `PolicyBinding` and `OptionsAdmission` publish validated frozen policy, `CompositionSurface.Compose` folds the module table and freezes the graph, and the `Lifecycle` cell transitions to Ready then Running. Telemetry, health, support, and outbound rails run beside the cell and surface through the seven port records; `DrainConductor.Drain` folds ranked participants into one `DrainReceipt` ending at Unloaded.

## [4]-[BOUNDARIES]

- AppHost is not a domain service layer, job framework, DI wrapper, telemetry wrapper, UI package, persistence package, compute implementation, or host-boundary package.
- AppHost owns runtime state and policy; app roots own process attachment, host events, and app-root-only pins (OTLP exporter, the MCP HTTP transport, the WASM/industrial-protocol runtimes, Kestrel/gRPC surfaces, Serilog host bridge and sinks).
- Statement carve-outs are named per fence: `Lifecycle`, `FaultSpine`, `ConfigLayer`, `Applied`, `Bundle`, `Evict`, `Publish`, `Connect`, `Execute`, `EventLog.Append`, `SandboxRows.Load`, `SupplyChainGate.Admit`, and `PowerProbe.Read` are the boundary capsules; every other member stays expression-shaped on typed rails.
- AppHost owns the self-describing op catalog, command transaction, grant/cost broker, MCP projection, plugin sandbox, solver contract, reactive external binding, and reproducibility kernel as runtime-policy axes; op execution stays Compute, durability stays Persistence, the MCP protocol routes to the official SDK, and the WASM and industrial-protocol runtimes stay app-root-pinned host surfaces. The grant broker owns permission-shape evaluation as its own typed `PermissionShape` × `GrantScope` value-object predicate.
- Sentinels stop at the admission seam: `ClockPolicy.Admit` projects platform defaults to `Option<Instant>`; interiors never see nulls, sentinels, or provider shapes.
- AppHost owns support trigger and correlation; contributing packages own artifact classification and payload projection through `SupportContributorPort` rows.
- Lib level emits `ILogger` and minted `ActivitySource`/`Meter` pairs only; exporter projection belongs to composition roots.

## [5]-[PROHIBITIONS]

The closed NEVER list — the deleted patterns the owner regions foreclose.

- NEVER a public type outside a sub-domain owner region; an eighth port record is the named defect.
- NEVER wrappers, rename adapters, helper or utility files, or thin forwarding surfaces over admitted packages.
- NEVER a generic receipt, ledger, or reported-value abstraction; every receipt stays its typed record.
- NEVER a second state machine, shutdown flag, or sibling phase enum beside `Lifecycle`; never a free-floating `CancellationTokenSource` below the `CancelScope` spine.
- NEVER `DateTime.UtcNow`, `DateTime.Now`, or direct `Stopwatch` call sites; `ClockPolicy` owns both clocks, and sentinels project to `Option<T>` at the admission seam.
- NEVER a bare duration literal; every bound traces to a `DeadlineClass` row or a page policy table.
- NEVER a second scheduler, a second cache owner, or a second retry owner on one seam; database retry stays at the Persistence execution strategy.
- NEVER ambient `IConfiguration` reads past bootstrap or interior `IOptions` handles; interiors read frozen policy records published at ready.
- NEVER `AddSingleton`/`AddScoped`/`AddTransient`/`AddKeyed*` descriptor spellings or closure-walking scans; `Describe`/`DescribeKeyed` rows and `FromAssemblies` only.
- NEVER a process-static `Meter` or `ActivitySource` outliving its provider; never Serilog types below composition roots; never OTLP exporter pins below service app roots.
- NEVER a hand-written STJ converter beside the generated Thinktecture and NodaTime converters; never an unredacted classified value at an exporter or bundle seam.
- NEVER posix traps or single-instance enforcement on plugin rows; host-attach injection drives phases there.
- NEVER a hand-rolled MCP JSON-RPC transport beside the official SDK, or a hand-rolled OPC-UA/MQTT/Modbus/serial/WASM client beside the certified stack (OPC-UA + MQTTnet + FluentModbus + System.IO.Ports + wasmtime-dotnet); a federated external MCP server's tools, resources, and prompts enter only as brokered `CapabilityDescriptor` rows through the one registry, never as an unbrokered side channel or a second tool catalog, and the in-process reasoning loop reuses the one brokered `CommandAIFunction` tool-adoption seam, never a second tool projection.
- NEVER an opaque model call: every `IChatClient` invocation (the in-process reasoning loop and the MCP server-sampling leg) composes the one `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` middleware pipeline — a model call is metered in `CostUnit.ModelTokens` through the `GrantBroker`, content-cached over the resources-lane `HybridCache`, traced through the GenAI span, and content-addressed into the `EventLog`; a second model cache, a per-call OTel span beside the decorators, or an unmetered un-ledgered model draw is the deleted form.
- NEVER a second op-metadata owner beside `CapabilityDescriptor`, a second permission-and-cost owner beside `GrantBroker`, an in-process third-party plugin outside the WASM/process isolation boundary, or a plugin-private geometry representation; a plugin speaks the Compute canonical `EncodedTensor` and dispatches through the command algebra.
- NEVER a second RNG or non-chained event log: `DeterminismContext` owns the seed and float mode, `EventLog` is the single hash-chained content-addressed command log riding the durable `OpLog`.
- NEVER a second notification sender, external-binding poller, alerting owner, or power monitor: `DeliveryFanout`, `ExternalTransport`/`LiveWire`, `AlertEngine`, and `FidelityScale` are read consumers of the existing hop/health/power signals, never parallel state machines.
- CSP analyzer diagnostics are architecture pressure: fix the shape, refine the rule on a false positive, never suppress.
