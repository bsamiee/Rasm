# [STACKS_PYTHON]

This folder is the Python stack decision atlas. It routes language, shape, surface, rail, boundary, numeric, system-API, runtime, and proof decisions to the concept page that owns the coding choice. The atlas builds one declaration-first paradigm: raw ingress becomes typed payload, payload materializes into one canonical owner, owner operations flow through `Option` or `Result`, and projections leave through explicit boundary or egress surfaces.

Pages carry no outside-source blocks, release narration, provenance, process state, project anchors, tool context, source-footnote blocks, or meta commentary. Pages name exact code, package, operator, generated-surface, and command spellings in code spans; verification happens before authoring, and the page states doctrine as fact.

## [02]-[DOCTRINE]

Sixteen laws in five groups govern every Python decision in this stack. Concept pages instantiate them; no page restates them. The laws exist so correctness is structural rather than disciplinary: admission-once makes the interior total over valid values; closed families turn a new case into one declaration and a stale `match` into a flagged arm; policy-as-values makes behavior recoverable from declarations alone; derivation makes every secondary surface provably consistent with its primary. Density is the consequence, not the goal — when one declaration carries the family, every remaining line is load-bearing. The atlas is sized for large systems: total lines and public surface grow sublinearly with capability because every owner is declared with the capacity to absorb the family it anchors — growth lands as cases, rows, and policy values inside existing owners, never as new surfaces beside them. Python ships no compiler totality checker, so the structural guarantee a closed family promises is only as real as the gate that flags the unhandled arm and the un-frozen owner — enforcement is therefore doctrine-first, the lint, type, and contract gate the doctrine's only compiled form and legislated harder than a checked language needs, the doctrine authoring the gate and never the reverse. Findings against these laws are architecture pressure: fix the shape, not the diagnostic.

[FLOW]:
- `EXPRESSION_SPINE` — all domain logic is expression-shaped; dependent steps compose monadically and independent computations compose applicatively — dependence licenses sequence through `bind`/`yield from`, independence licenses accumulation through `map2` and a fault-combining fold, and the carrier, never a flag, selects the combination algebra. A `bind` chain over independent operands reports only the first failure and silently discards the rest, so choosing abort versus accumulate is a correctness decision fixed once at the boundary. Statements survive only inside measured kernels and platform-forced boundaries, and any page that shows one names the exemption. Composition runs through `pipe`, `compose`, `@effect.result`, comprehensions, and `match` used as an expression of record.
- `BOUNDARY_ADMISSION` — raw material is admitted exactly once into an evidence-carrying owner; interior code never re-validates and never sees `None`-as-failure, sentinels, or provider shapes. The lifecycle is `Raw -> Payload -> Canonical owner -> Rail -> Projection -> Egress`: `Option` carries non-failing absence, `Result` carries fallibility, exceptions convert at the owning boundary.

[SHAPE]:
- `SHAPE_BUDGET` — a concept owns exactly one type; variants are cases inside one closed family, never sibling types. Families are closed internally, semi-closed at versioned boundaries, and open only where foreign code must extend without editing the owner. Three or more parallel shapes, sibling factories, repeated dispatch arms, or single-call helpers is the collapse trigger, not a style preference.
- `DEEP_SURFACES` — prefer one rich polymorphic surface over many shallow ones; each module exposes one entrypoint family and keeps internals private. One deep owner that holds a full concern beats four fragments that scatter it.
- `MODAL_ARITY` — one entrypoint owns all call modalities; singular, plural, batch, and stream discriminate on the shape of the input value — type, tag, pattern, or arity — never on name suffixes or boolean knobs. A parallel parameter that describes the input is a knob smuggled back in; the discriminant must be recoverable from the value itself.
- `ANTICIPATORY_COLLAPSE` — an owner is shaped for the family it will absorb, not the instance in hand: the moment a second case, dimension, knob, or modality is conceivable, the shape generalizes so the next requirement lands as a case, a row, a policy value, or a carrier swap with zero new surface. The proof of a correct shape is the diff of the next feature — one declaration inside the owner, every consumer untouched or broken loudly at compile time. Sizing for the instance and widening later is the rejected order: widening after call sites exist multiplies surfaces, widening before they exist is one polymorphic dispatch.

[DERIVATION]:
- `POLICY_VALUES` — configuration enters as one domain value that carries its own behavior — a vocabulary member, tagged variant, or frozen policy table — never as flag sets whose combinations the implementation must re-derive. Behavior rows live with the vocabulary that selects them.
- `DERIVED_LOGIC` — when cases share generative structure, the logic is derived — a `frozendict` table, fold, or comprehension — never enumerated arms. One primary correspondence is declared and every secondary map derives from it; a derived form is replaced only where a structurally cheaper primitive exists, and the replacement preserves the law the derivation encodes — the derivation is the executable specification.
- `DERIVED_TYPES` — types are computed where the language allows so one declaration yields the family: inline type parameters with defaults, `TypeForm`, variadic generics, and `@dataclass_transform` owners replace rank-specific or per-provider type copies.
- `SYMBOLIC_REFERENCE` — names, paths, discriminants, and correspondences travel as symbols and derived values — enum members, `Path` algebra, vocabulary tables — never as string literals that restate something the program already knows.
- `SEMANTIC_NAMING` — every file, namespace, type, method, local function, parameter, field, property, case, test, artifact, and region name uses the bounded context's canonical term, grammatical role, and tense. One semantic word is the default; two words are allowed when owner plus action, result, axis, or boundary is load-bearing; three words are the ceiling unless a generated contract, external API, or ambiguity proof requires more. Operations use action verbs, values and receipts use result nouns, policies and vocabularies use stable noun or adjective rows, and boundary adapters preserve foreign names only at the seam. Renaming for variety, tense drift, abbreviations, prefix/suffix families, and parallel file/member/type labels for one concept are rejected.

[MATERIAL]:
- `LIBRARY_DEPTH` — admitted packages are the standard library: `expression` for rails and composition, `pydantic` for admission and settings, `msgspec` for wire codecs, `anyio` for structured concurrency, `stamina` for retry, `beartype` for runtime contracts, `numpy` for array numerics, `structlog` and OpenTelemetry for observability. Use the deepest primitive the package itself reaches for; wrappers, rename adapters, and stdlib-first reflexes are rejected. Language primitives remain owners only when they carry the invariant directly.
- `DEFINITION_TIME_ASPECTS` — cross-cutting capability — retry, observability, contracts, validation, memoization, registration — attaches at definition time as a signature-preserving, rail-preserving decorator with inline `**P` and `functools.wraps`. Aspects materialize policy, stack in deterministic order, and never raise inside domain flow; two to four recurring wrappers collapse into one parameterized aspect factory.

[INTEGRATION]:
- `ROOT_REBUILD` — new capability is woven into the owning shape as if it had always existed; reshape the owner rather than appending beside it. No shims, compat aliases, `[Obsolete]` layers, or migration surfaces — break the API when the collapse improves the system.
- `ONE_HOP_RESOLUTION` — a name resolves to its semantics in one hop: no alias-to-constant-to-enum-to-class chains, no forwarding helpers, no helper or util shells, no convenience wrappers. A value that takes two jumps to trace marks a layer to delete.
- `COMPOSED_IMPLEMENTATION` — a feature of any complexity is implemented by composing the page owners — admitted shapes, typed rails, dispatch surfaces, boundary projections, numeric routes — before any new scaffold is named. The pages are one body, and the same concern resolves identically wherever it appears. A need with no composed spelling marks a missing case in an owning page's law: the law extends first, the feature lands second. Cards and snippets show this composition at full operator depth. Flat code — logic below the operator depth the admitted packages reach — is surface sprawl in time: it re-derives, line by line, what a deeper composed form states once.

| :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |

|  [12]   | the same 2-4 wrappers recur together                | one parameterized aspect                 |

## [04]-[RULE_ENFORCEMENT]

The doctrine's compiled form is the lint, type, and contract gate: `Ruff` (`select = ["ALL"]`, preview), strict `ty`, strict `mypy`, the custom AST analyzer under `tools/py_analyzer`, and `beartype` boundary contracts are the enforcement surfaces, and the manifest owns every rule pin and message. The loop is one-directional — a doctrine page legislates, a gate enforces; a rule never introduces law of its own.

- Mapping law: every doctrine law maps to its enforcing gate. Banned imports and rename-wrapper avoidance ride `flake8-tidy-imports.banned-api` and `banned-module-level-imports` (`asyncio` -> `anyio`, `abc.ABC`/`abstractmethod` -> `Protocol`, `contextlib.suppress` -> rails, `json.*` -> `msgspec`, `logging.*` -> `structlog`, `os.environ` -> pydantic-settings, raw sockets/subprocess -> `anyio`); totality and absence laws ride `match` exhaustiveness under `ty`/`mypy` with `assert_never`; immutability rides frozen-owner checks and `extend-immutable-calls`; boundary typing rides `beartype` and `runtime-evaluated-decorators`; relative-import and lazy-import bans ride `ban-relative-imports`/`ban-lazy`. A law with no mechanical gate is captured as a `tools/py_analyzer` AST rule.
- Promotion law: a doctrine-breaking anti-pattern that no shipped Ruff rule, `ty` check, or `mypy` error already rejects — class/type/string/constant spam, a one-method class, a `get`/`get_many` family, a private-dunder enum probe, a thin rename wrapper — is captured as a `tools/py_analyzer` AST rule and promoted to error. Style preferences and anything an existing gate already rejects are not new rules.
- Shape law: a rule describes the semantic shape of the anti-pattern — trigger, predicate, exemption — never a namespace, path, or one-off symbol; every rule ships with positive spans that fire and valid dense code that must not.
- Finding law: a true positive is architecture pressure — fix the shape, never the diagnostic; a false positive or a fix that adds ceremony without improving the system is rule pressure — refine the rule. `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, and `@beartype` opt-outs are neither, and a suppression that adds ceremony without improving correctness is itself the defect.

## [05]-[PAGE_CRAFT]

How pages in this folder are authored. The corpus is one body; these laws keep it coherent.

- Atlas law: this README owns doctrine and the routing table; each concept page owns one disjoint layer and is the only file barred from re-teaching a sibling's mechanic. A page names a sibling owner in a code span only to fix the shed boundary of its own layer — the concern lives there, the consequence lands here — and that bare ownership pointer is the page's whole reference to the sibling; cohesion comes from shared law, never from one page reconstructing another's surface. The README is the only file that carries a Markdown link.
- Zero meta: concept pages carry no provenance, source trace, release narration, process state, project, tool, or skill context.
- Page grammar: narrow index table, then family cards, then the snippet beside the rule it proves; the page ends at its last card section. Structure is identical across stack folders; content never is.
- Card fields are earned: `Use / Accept / Reject / Law / Boundary` lines appear on a card only where each one decides something; a field line that decides nothing is deleted, not filled.
- Snippet law: every snippet compiles under the active surface; identifiers are legal neutral names; placeholder strings such as `"<value-a>"` appear only inside literals; no project, host, or domain concept anchors a snippet.
- Snippet coverage: each snippet is doctrine-exemplary at full operator depth, roughly 3-4x denser than ordinary code, and exercises a surface region no other snippet in the corpus shows — variety within the doctrine, zero duplicated demonstrations. The region is the snippet's spotlight demonstration; finalized surfaces composed as supporting material occupy no region and duplicate nothing.
- Scale fidelity: a snippet shows the form at the shape it takes in a large system — admission, dispatch, rail, and policy composed in one fence with the growth axis visible — never an isolated minimum; a statement-bearing snippet sits beside the Exemption line naming its platform-forced seam.
- Code names before prose: every member a card or snippet names — attribute, knob, operator, generated surface — is verified against the installed package implementation before it is written; an unconfirmable claim is not authored, and a nameable surface spelled as prose is a defect — the code span is the instruction.
- Card economy: cards are few, deep, and evidence-dense; near-peer cards merge until each retained card owns a decision cluster, and a card line carries exactly one decision. A thin card deciding one concept is a sibling line, not an owner.
- Snippet adherence: snippets obey the card they prove, compose finalized laws as supporting material, and reduce lines and surface through parameterization, algorithmic structure, and package depth, never by deleting capability.
- Altitude routing: when two pages touch one fact, the ledger records the split — mechanics at the owning page, consequence at the consumer; prose re-teaching an owned mechanic is repaired by routing to the owner, while composing owned surfaces inside a snippet is supporting material and owns nothing.
- Reject columns are load-bearing: every `Use` names the spelling, wrapper, or local pattern it deletes.
- Tables enumerate, cards legislate: rows stay atomic and narrow — no prose cramming, no links inside cells; nuance moves to a card.
- Route scope is README-local: lookup rows and conflict rules live in README files; concept pages carry only the law they own.
- Manifest truth: package versions, admitted packages, tool settings, lock state, and graph admission live in `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and Python tool configuration; no package-named pages; a package is named only where it changes the implementation choice.

## [06]-[CORPUS_LAW]

How the corpus accretes. The folder is one cohesive body, not isolated pages; atlas order is implementation order. The atlas `[STATE]` column is the law registry: a `finalized` page is binding law for every page authored after it; a `partial` page carries no authority and awaits rebuild; a `target` page exists only as roadmap scope. Finalization is a one-way gate — a context-free cold grade of the full page and every snippet, converging to a zero-edit pass, flips the state; the producer's grade admits, the cold grade decides.

- Three-layer inheritance: every page is authored under the doctrine, under every finalized page — adhered to, never restated, never referenced, never contradicted — and from its own source reservoir.
- Prose consumes earlier layers as given: vocabulary, owners, rails, and policy values arrive settled, never re-taught, and the page spends its lines only on its own layer.
- Reservoir residue: a page's source workspace deliberately holds more than the page prints, and it outlives the page — later enrichment and snippet work mine it without source-footnoting it; depth beyond one page's budget is corpus capital, never waste.
- Snippet stacking: code fully captures the card it proves, then composes on earlier layers' law at full doctrine depth — the new surface in the spotlight, established surfaces as supporting material, every touched concern built at the standard its owning finalized page legislates.
- Region ledger: the workspace root keeps one ledger of owned regions — page concerns at card altitude, snippet demonstrations at fence altitude. Snippet rows are written before code exists, page rows at finalization, and a duplicated region is repaired by routing to its owner, never by re-teaching — the ledger is what makes ownership checkable without re-reading the corpus.
- Purpose: the corpus is loaded as the operative standard in place of weaker context; zero-meta, zero-anchor, and stated-as-fact are absolute because any provenance, hedge, or stale claim poisons every downstream generation that loads the page.
