description: Estate secret custody and consumption over 1Password and Doppler — op as the permanent local store, Doppler as the runtime backend, scoped CLI reads, directory-scope resolution, the SessionStart pull rail, service-token custody classes, secret-file templating, and the read-only Doppler MCP row. Use when reading or wiring secrets, minting or routing tokens, debugging missing session env keys, rendering secret-bearing config files, or touching op/doppler surfaces. Topology mutation — projects, configs, tokens, scopes — belongs to Parametric_Forge/services/topology.ts and its driver, never to ad-hoc CLI calls or per-repo files.

# [SECRETS]

Two permanent backends custody estate secrets. 1Password (`op`) is the local store: the `Tokens` vault holds every API key, service token, IaC credential, and Pulumi passphrase, the `Personal` vault holds the `Forge SSH Key`, and `op inject` resolves them into the mode-600 op cache (`~/.config/hm-op-session.sh`) on every `forge-redeploy --switch` — the bootstrap baseline a fresh machine emits from before any Doppler token exists. Doppler is the runtime backend: op-served config-scoped service tokens resolve its declared configs, and its session cache overlays the op baseline with fresher per-key values. Both stores are maintained forever; neither retires the other.

Topology — projects, environments, configs, service tokens, directory scopes — lives as IaC rows in `Parametric_Forge/services/topology.ts`, materialized by `estate.ts` and applied by `driver.ts` over the Pulumi Automation API. `doppler` reads and writes secret values against declared configs; the SessionStart hook is the sole consumption rail; `~/.doppler` holds CLI config and fallback state.

## [01]-[ROUTING]

- [01]-[PATTERNS](references/patterns.md): pattern doctrine — template rendering, mounts, multi-command wrappers, MCP row shape, plan-gated features.

## [02]-[RESOLUTION]

- `~/.doppler` is the CLI config dir; scopes ride `~/.doppler/.doppler.yaml`, written by `doppler configure set` through the driver's `scopes apply`.
- A repo-local `doppler.yaml` is vendor setup guidance, not the estate scope owner; the estate carries none.
- Precedence, highest first: a service token's embedded project/config, runtime flags, env vars, config-file scope.
- Config-file scope resolves an exact directory match before the nearest ancestor.
- Scope env vars: `DOPPLER_TOKEN`, `DOPPLER_PROJECT`, `DOPPLER_CONFIG`, `DOPPLER_CONFIG_DIR`, `DOPPLER_PASSPHRASE`.
- Agents pass `--project`/`--config` explicitly; env carries only token custody and hook mode switches.
- An ambient `DOPPLER_TOKEN` outranks flags and represents one config; strip it with `env -u DOPPLER_TOKEN` when fetching more than one source.

- One directory's scope keys land as `enclave.project`, `enclave.config`; the set is driver-owned and scope `/` stays untouched.
- Secret downloads pipe to `jq 'keys'` or `jq 'length'`; configure reads strip the root token with `del(.token)`, since a bare `configure debug` or `configure --all` prints it.
- Receipts, transcripts, and logs carry key names and counts, never values or tokens.

## [04]-[OP_CLI]

`op` reads the local store directly; the field suffix is `token`, `credential`, or `password` per item. An exported `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` pins `op` to the `Tokens` vault, so `Personal` (the SSH key) resolves only under `env -u OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.

| [INDEX] | [TASK]                       | [COMMAND]                                                                    |

|  [07]   | Rename an item to its real name | `op item edit "<old-title>" title="<official-name>" --vault Tokens`       |

- `op` serves the SSH key to `ssh`, `git`, WezTerm, Yazi, and rclone through the 1Password agent socket; the item ref lives in `1Password/ssh/agent.toml`, never a private key on disk.
- Read a secret only to verify presence or wire a one-off; standing consumption rides the pull rail, never inline `op read` in durable code.

## [05]-[PULL_RAIL]

SessionStart hook `.claude/hooks/setup-env.sh` is the only consumption rail, canonical in Parametric_Forge and byte-identical in every repo copy. A warm session replays its cache into `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` and dispatches a detached refresh; a cold boot resolves Doppler inline.

- `DOPPLER_SOURCES` rows carry the shape `project:config:snapshot[:TOKEN_ENV_VAR]`; each resolves independently and in parallel.
- `TOKEN_ENV_VAR` names an op-served config-scoped service token; an empty or unset segment falls back to ambient CLI auth, and a degraded token retries ambient once and blames the token in the receipt.
- A live fetch rewrites its encrypted snapshot under `~/.cache/doppler`; a failed fetch serves the snapshot; a dead row is loud and names the keys it owes.
- `CLAUDE_DOPPLER_OFFLINE=1` forces fallback-only fetches; `CLAUDE_DOPPLER_STALE_DAYS` (default 14) marks aged snapshots `STALE`.
- `jq` parses each JSON dump into a literal assignment, so secret bytes never reach a shell parser; receipts land at `~/.cache/forge-secrets/receipt`.

## [06]-[CUSTODY]

Local custody is `op`, never the OS keychain: every service, IaC, and MCP token plus the SSH key lives in a `Tokens` or `Personal` vault item. A personal `doppler login` is the one credential Doppler keeps in the keychain, used for the operator's ad-hoc interactive work alone — no rail depends on it.

| [INDEX] | [CLASS]                          | [CUSTODY]                             | [USE]                           |
| :-----: | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
|  [01]   | Config-scoped service token      | `op://Tokens/DOPPLER_*_READONLY`      | Hook and runtime reads          |
|  [02]   | IaC admin token                  | `op://Tokens/DOPPLER_IAC_TOKEN/token` | Topology writes via Pulumi only |
|  [03]   | Pulumi stack passphrase          | `op://Tokens/PULUMI_FORGE_SERVICES/password` | Stack state decryption   |
|  [04]   | MCP token                        | Injected as `DOPPLER_TOKEN`           | Read-only agent MCP             |
|  [05]   | Provider PATs (GitHub and peers) | `op://Tokens` items, mirrored into configs | Consumed through the pull rail |

- Config-scoped service token: minted by topology rows; static Developer-plan tokens are revoked and reminted, never rotated in place.
- IaC admin token and stack passphrase: brokered by `driver.ts`; an ambient `DOPPLER_TOKEN` or `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` short-circuits the op read per run.
- MCP token: injected through the doppler-run indirection, its grants the enforcement, while `--read-only --project --config` narrow only the tool surface.
- Provider PATs are never topology identity.

## [07]-[LAW]

- One item, one official name: an item carries the credential's real published name, never a handrolled synonym; a consumer needing a different env-var name renames the item at the source and repoints every reader, never adds a second item or a duplicate export aliasing the same secret. A naming mistake is fixed by renaming in `op` and Doppler, never papered over.
- A new project lands as project/config rows in `Parametric_Forge/services/topology.ts` and a directory scope row, then `pulumi up`; retiring it deletes its rows.
- A repo carries zero Doppler files; its agents resolve through scope plus hook automatically.
- GitHub Actions secret sync stays rejected until a workflow consumer exists; each sync spends a Developer-plan slot and imports no existing GitHub values.
- Rendered secret material is ephemeral: `--mount`/`--mount-template` over durable renders; plaintext binds only where the target owner requires it.
