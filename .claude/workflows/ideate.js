    description:
        'Rebuild a folder IDEAS + TASKS card pool to world-class: survey the realized corpus and research the real domain, author the genuinely-deferred idea/task pool, then fix-in-place constructive critique + hostile adversarial redteam. Language-agnostic (cards are markdown governed by the card schema). Authors NO design pages (that is the rebuild-* workflows) and aligns nothing pre-existing for its own sake (that is align-cards) — this is the greenfield/expansion pool generator. Every agent call takes a slot in one agent-level scheduler so the true in-flight agent count stays at cap while all folder chains run concurrently; within a folder the survey -> ideate -> critique -> redteam chain holds because each stage consumes the prior stage\'s landed cards, and a folder above the survey page cap runs two page-slice survey agents whose maps merge before the ideate stage. Survey lanes (including the page-slice splits) run read-only on gpt-5.6-terra dispatched through sonnet codex wrappers (CODEX flag; false restores native opus); ideate and redteam stay fable writers, and critique runs as ONE gpt-5.6-sol codex lane per folder (workspace-write; cardlog to disk, receipt on the wire; the redteam reads it from disk as refutation targets and folds its verified files into the folder record). Every stage writes BOTH ends of every Ripple itself — a cross-folder counterpart is authored or repaired directly in the sibling folder\'s card files in the same pass under the current-state law; nothing routes to a later phase. Every writing stage also nominates generalizable lessons into a required-usually-empty harvest, folded forward through the redteam and the orphan drain; one terminal doctrine lander then adjudicates the pooled harvest against the docs/laws admission bar (land-nothing legal) before the run closes. The terminal stays the single fold-forward orphan drain, not a round-based DRAIN LOOP: Ripples land both ends in-pass by design and the cardlog carries no {files, claim} backlog, so nothing pools across stages. args = optional scope (e.g. "libs/python/geometry"); empty = all of libs.',
