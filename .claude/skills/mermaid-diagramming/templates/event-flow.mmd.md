# [EVENT_FLOW]

Draw which commands produce which events and which read models consume them, in timeline order. Template law bakes in the event-modeling discipline an unassisted attempt scrambles — frames land in strict causal order because relations infer from the nearest prior frame in a different lane, so declaration order IS the arrow set; payloads annotate the frames whose shape is the contract; and each frame kind reads its own `em*` pair so the lane semantics render. Use `eventmodeling` with 6-10 `tf` frames across the ui, command/read-model, and event lanes; `accTitle`/`accDescr` break the parser before the frames, so the relation sentence rides beside the fence. Box text hardcodes a bold sans inside `foreignObject` spans — the `.em-box span` stamp restores the mono ramp, `.em-box code` inks payloads Cyan, and `.em-swimlane text` carries the lane titles in Lavender. A read model fed by no upstream event is the defect the frame order makes visible.

Refill by renaming frames to the real command-event chain in causal order — the implicit relation chain is the assertion, so a frame that must source from an earlier lane declares immediately after it; namespaced ids (`stream.Name`) open extra lanes per stream. `em*` pairs, mono span stamp, Cyan payload ink, and Lavender lane titles are fixed law — a refill renames the flow, never strips the fidelity surface.
