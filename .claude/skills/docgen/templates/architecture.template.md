# [H1][ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE]
>**Dictum:** *Architecture scaffolding encodes structural contracts, not implementation details.*

<br>

Produces one ARCHITECTURE.md file at appropriate scope level. Section selection determined by `architecture-gen.md` §3[SCOPE_ROUTING]. `docs/standards/architecture-standards.md` defines content requirements per section.

**Density:** System-level ARCHITECTURE.md targets 100-250 lines. Below 100 signals missing sections; above 250 signals scope creep into implementation detail.<br>
**References:** `architecture-gen.md` (exploration, section generation, scope routing), `architecture-standards.md` (canonical structure, diagram types, invariants), `validation.md` (compliance checklist), `patterns.md` (anti-patterns).<br>
**Workflow:** Fill placeholders, remove guidance comments, verify diagrams render, validate against architecture-standards.md §4.

# ${SystemName} — Architecture

## System Overview

<!-- One paragraph: business problem + system purpose. -->
<!-- C4 Context diagram: system as central node; external actors as surrounding nodes. -->

${ProblemDomain}

```mermaid
graph LR
    ${ExternalActor1} -->|${Protocol1}| ${SystemName}
    ${ExternalActor2} -->|${Protocol1}| ${SystemName}
    ${SystemName} -->|${Protocol2}| ExternalService
```

## High-Level Architecture

<!-- Component/container diagram: 3-7 bounded contexts with directional data flow. -->
<!-- Select diagram type per architecture-gen.md §2.2. -->

```mermaid
graph LR
    ${Component1} -->|${Protocol2}| ${Component2}
    ${Component1} -->|${Protocol2}| ${Component3}
```

<!-- Responsibility table: one row per component. -->

| Component         | Responsibility                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **${Component1}** | <!-- One-line responsibility. --> |
| **${Component2}** | <!-- One-line responsibility. --> |
| **${Component3}** | <!-- One-line responsibility. --> |

## Codemap

<!-- Annotated directory structure. 2-3 levels deep. Entry points emphasized. -->

```
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # ⭐ Entry point
│   ├── modules/

## Key Design Decisions

<!-- Summarized decisions linking to full ADRs. Current (Accepted) only. -->

- ${ADRRef1} — <!-- One-line summary + primary justification. -->

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Authentication:** ${AuthMechanism}<br>
**Error handling:** ${ErrorStrategy}<br>
**Logging:** ${LoggingStrategy}<br>
**Observability:** <!-- Metrics, traces, health checks. -->

## Invariants

1. ${Invariant1}
2. <!-- Additional invariants. Each testable, each with violation consequence. -->

**Guidance**

*System vs. Implementation Detail* — ARCHITECTURE.md maps bounded contexts, data flow directions, and system invariants. Class names, file paths, and function signatures belong in code documentation. Codemap shows 2-3 levels of directory nesting — deeper structure belongs in package-level READMEs. Think "map of a country, not an atlas of its states."<br>
*Diagram Type Selection* — Microservices default to `graph LR` showing containers; monoliths default to `graph TD` showing layers. Use sequence diagrams for critical runtime flows (authentication, order lifecycle). Use state diagrams for stateful workflows. Each diagram type answers different architectural questions.<br>
*ADR Summarization* — Key Design Decisions section summarizes and links — never duplicates. One line per decision: what was decided, which driver justified it, link to the full ADR. Deprecated and superseded decisions appear only in the ADR index.
