# [UI_ARCHITECTURE]

The domain map of `ui` — the W4 component-capability folder, two Nx projects in one folder: the `ui` core carrying the atom, token, act, view, and intl planes on the React 19 spine, and `ui/viewer` (`scope:viewer`) carrying the spatial/GLB/geo/BCF tier compile-time excluded from non-spatial apps. Components are capability, boot is runtime — `ui` and `browser` are peers an app composes; the permitted folder edges are `kernel`, `state`, and `wire` through the `#vocab` subpath only.

Each codemap node is the eventual source file its `.planning/` design page becomes, named in the language's own folder and file casing — PascalCase `.cs`, lowercase `.py`, lowercase `.ts`. Treat every node as realized code; the `.planning/` scaffold is the authoring substrate, never part of the map.

Growth lands on owning rows: a new component family is a `view` row; a new token axis is a `token` row; a new interaction pattern is an `act` row; a new locale is `intl` catalog data, never a lib edit; a new viewer overlay is a `mark` row; a new panel kind is one `panel` row over its wire vocabulary.

```

Every `[WIRE]` row decodes once at `wire`; `ui` types the decoded values through the `wire` `#vocab` subpath only — the codec machinery interior is unexported, so a `ui` module physically cannot resolve it. `ui` and `browser` never import each other: where a component needs a runtime capability, `ui` declares the port record (`GlbViewport` decode-worker residency) and `browser` provides the Layer at app composition; the app root wires the port.
