# [@duckdb/node-api] — the embedded single-node OLAP engine: async native bindings behind the `lane/olap` node row

`@duckdb/node-api` (the "Neo" bindings) is the official promise-native DuckDB binding — vectorized in-process analytics with lossless type support, streaming result readers, and prepared-statement binds. It is a raw promise API, not an Effect service: the OLAP lane wraps instance/connection lifecycle in `Effect.acquireRelease` under `Scope` and lifts every call through `Effect.tryPromise`. The engine reads Parquet/CSV/JSON/Arrow zero-copy, range-reads object storage through `httpfs`, `ATTACH`es Postgres/SQLite, and speaks DuckLake/Iceberg/Delta through extensions — the single-node analytical row of the lane, with ClickHouse past the distributed trigger and `pg_duckdb` for analytics-in-OLTP.

## [01]-[PACKAGE_SURFACE]

[PACKAGE_SURFACE]: `@duckdb/node-api`
- package: `@duckdb/node-api`
- version: `1.5.4-r.1`
- license: `MIT`
- backing: `@duckdb/node-bindings` (N-API native, prebuilt platform binaries)
- runtime: `runtime:node`/bun services and CLI; the browser row is `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` (`.api/duckdb-wasm.md`)
- rail: `lane/olap` embedded node row — no Effect peer; boundary-kernel wrap is the lane's

## [04]-[IMPLEMENTATION_LAW]

[INTEGRATION_LAW]:
- Boundary-kernel wrap: every promise lifts through `Effect.tryPromise` with a typed lane fault; instance and connection ride `Effect.acquireRelease` under `Scope`; readers lift to `Stream` at the lane seam.
- Arrow is the wire (`.api/apache-arrow.md`): result interchange with the wasm row, the viewer, and ClickHouse rides Arrow IPC — never row-materialized re-encoding.
- Storage law: single-file ACID, single concurrent writer, out-of-core spill — the embedded ceiling; past it the workload moves to the ClickHouse row, never to a second embedded instance fleet.

[LOCAL_ADMISSION]:
- The engine is an analytical accelerator, never a record of truth; journal facts flow in, verdicts flow out.
- Extension load (`INSTALL`/`LOAD`) is grant-shaped — the lane records which extensions a deployment admits; a load failure refuses the capability, never crashes the lane.

[RAIL_LAW]:
- Package: `@duckdb/node-api`
- Owns: the embedded single-node analytical engine — instance/connect lifecycle, run/read/stream/prepared execution, extension SQL admission
- Accept: scoped acquire-release wrap, `tryPromise` lifts, Arrow interchange, `httpfs`/`ATTACH`/DuckLake as statements
- Reject: the legacy `duckdb` npm binding, OLAP-in-OLTP-transaction coupling, a second hand-rolled analytical client, unscoped instance leaks
