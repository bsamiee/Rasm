        'Cold-verify pass over one or more landed campaigns. Per campaign: one sonnet plan partitions the target folder into balanced verification slices; gpt-5.6-terra (codex) verifiers fan out through sonnet dispatch wrappers (CODEX flag; false restores native opus), each reading the root doc IN FULL plus its slice pages IN FULL, hunting missing/wrong/faked/naive work with typed anchored findings (one verifier owns the governance lane: index docs, manifest rows, csproj/README registries, .api anchors, acceptance traces, rider receipts; a per-language-branch verifier owns the cross-libs ripple lane: every sibling seam ledger, consumer anchor, counterpart obligation, and frozen wire name the campaign touches outside the target root). Every verifier runs a mandatory second-pass self-verify: each finding adversarially re-derived from disk before return, vague or unconfirmed findings deleted, and a clean verdict asserted only after the second hostile pass returns empty. ONE terminal fable resolver then finalizes the campaign with LIBS-WIDE ripple authority — verifier findings are SIGNALS, not law: it re-verifies each on disk, implements the strongest fix where a suggestion was weak or short-sighted, hunts and fixes what the verifiers missed on its own authority, resolves every ripple its edits expose anywhere under libs/ (sibling counterparts repaired in place both ends, except where the doc rules a counterpart recorded-only), and pushes touched pages past the ruling per the floor law. The resolver is retry-guarded and appends each harvest nomination to a deterministic .jsonl as it is minted; when any campaign pools a non-empty nomination OR its resolver dies, ONE terminal fable doctrine lander adjudicates against docs/laws (refutation-first, land-nothing legal), sweeping the disk harvest files so a dead finalize loses none.
