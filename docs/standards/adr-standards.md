# [H1][ADR-STANDARDS]
>**Dictum:** *Decisions decay without records; records decay without structure.*

<br>

[CRITICAL] ADRs capture the reasoning behind architectural choices. The record survives longer than the author's memory.

---
## [1][FORMAT]
>**Dictum:** *MADR extends Nygard with evaluation rigor.*

<br>

Markdown Any Decision Record (MADR) structure. Use seven sections in fixed order.

| [INDEX] | [SECTION]          | [REQUIRED] | [CONTENT]                                                          |
| :-----: | ------------------ | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | Title              |    Yes     | `# ADR-NNNN: <Noun Phrase>`. Sequential numbering.                 |
|   [2]   | Status             |    Yes     | Exactly one: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded, Rejected. |
|   [3]   | Context            |    Yes     | Facts and forces. No narrative history.                            |
|   [4]   | Decision Drivers   |    Yes     | Ranked list of forces influencing the decision.                    |
|   [5]   | Considered Options |    Yes     | Minimum 2 options. Each with pros, cons, neutral impacts.          |
|   [6]   | Decision Outcome   |    Yes     | Chosen option with justification linked to drivers.                |
|   [7]   | Consequences       |    Yes     | Positive, negative, neutral — all explicit. No omissions.          |

### [1.1][NUMBERING]

Use sequential four-digit numbering: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`. Gaps permitted (deleted ADRs leave gaps). Numbers are never reused.

### [1.2][STATUS_TAXONOMY]

| [INDEX] | [STATUS]   | [MEANING]                                   | [TRANSITION_TO]        |
| :-----: | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|   [1]   | Proposed   | Under review. Not yet binding.              | Accepted, Rejected     |
|   [2]   | Accepted   | Binding. Implementation may proceed.        | Deprecated, Superseded |
|   [3]   | Deprecated | No longer applicable. Context changed.      | —                      |
|   [4]   | Superseded | Replaced by newer ADR. Backlink required.   | —                      |
|   [5]   | Rejected   | Reviewed and declined. Reasoning preserved. | —                      |

[IMPORTANT]:
1. [ALWAYS] **Supersession backlink:** `Superseded by [ADR-NNNN](./ADR-NNNN.md)` in Status section.
2. [ALWAYS] **Forward link:** Superseding ADR references predecessor: `Supersedes [ADR-NNNN](./ADR-NNNN.md)`.

---
## [2][DECISION_TYPES]
>**Dictum:** *Type determines evaluation criteria.*

<br>

| [INDEX] | [TYPE]               | [EVALUATION_CRITERIA]                                           | [RISK_DIMENSIONS]                    |
| :-----: | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | Technology Selection | Maturity, community, license, integration cost, migration path  | Vendor lock-in, EOL risk, skill gap  |
|   [2]   | Architecture Pattern | Coupling reduction, testability, performance impact, complexity | Over-engineering, under-engineering  |
|   [3]   | Process Change       | Team velocity impact, onboarding friction, rollback feasibility | Adoption resistance, tooling cost    |
|   [4]   | Security Boundary    | Threat model coverage, compliance impact, audit trail           | False sense of security, performance |
|   [5]   | Infrastructure       | Operational cost, scaling model, failure modes, observability   | Blast radius, recovery time          |

## [3][CONTENT_DISCIPLINE]
>**Dictum:** *Facts over narrative; forces over opinions.*

<br>

### [3.1][CONTEXT]

State current facts. Describe constraints. Identify unknowns explicitly. No chronological narrative—readers need situation, not story.

[IMPORTANT]:
1. [ALWAYS] **Bullet-point facts:** Each fact is independently verifiable.
2. [ALWAYS] **Explicit unknowns:** `Unknown: <what we don't know and why it matters>`.

[CRITICAL]:
- [NEVER] History narration: "First we tried X, then Y happened..."
- [NEVER] Opinion framing: "We believe...", "It seems..."

### [3.2][DECISION_DRIVERS]

Rank by impact. Each driver is force (technical constraint, business requirement, team capability, timeline) pushing toward or against options.

### [3.3][CONSIDERED_OPTIONS]

Minimum 2 options. "Do nothing" is valid when applicable. Per option:
- Describe approach in one paragraph.
- Pros: concrete benefits (measurable where possible).
- Cons: concrete costs (measurable where possible).
- Neutral: trade-offs that are neither positive nor negative.

### [3.4][CONSEQUENCES]

Include three categories—all required: `Positive:`, `Negative:`, `Neutral:`.

[IMPORTANT]:
1. [ALWAYS] **Mitigation for negatives:** Each negative consequence includes a mitigation strategy — the specific action, timeline, or architectural guard that reduces impact.
2. [ALWAYS] **Measurable where possible:** Consequences state observable outcomes, not vague concerns.

[CRITICAL]:
- [NEVER] Omit negative consequences—this is most common ADR failure. Every architectural choice has trade-offs.
- [NEVER] State "no significant downsides"—this signals incomplete analysis, not superior option.

## [4][LIFECYCLE]
>**Dictum:** *Records evolve; decisions do not retroactively change.*

<br>

### [4.1][AMENDMENT_VS_NEW]

| [INDEX] | [CONDITION]                           | [ACTION]                                         |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | Minor clarification, typo fix         | Amend existing ADR. Note amendment date.         |
|   [2]   | Context changed, decision still holds | Amend Context section. Note amendment rationale. |
|   [3]   | Decision no longer appropriate        | New ADR superseding the original.                |
|   [4]   | Decision reversed                     | New ADR. Original marked Superseded.             |

### [4.2][STALENESS_DETECTION]

An ADR is stale when:
- Selected technology no longer exists in dependency graph.
- Addressed constraint no longer exists.
- 3+ engineers cannot explain why decision was made.

Mark stale ADRs as Deprecated with note explaining why.

- [ ] Decision Drivers are ranked by impact.
- [ ] Minimum 2 Considered Options with pros/cons/neutral.
- [ ] Decision Outcome references specific drivers that justify selection.
- [ ] Consequences section has all three categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
