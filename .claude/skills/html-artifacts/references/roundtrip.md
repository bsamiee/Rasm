# [ROUNDTRIP]

The artifact is one turn in an agent conversation: it renders the agent's proposal, captures the human's judgment, and exports a payload the next turn executes. Capture is model mutation, the export serializes the model, and the consuming agent treats the payload as data whose decision fields select its next action.

## [01]-[CAPTURE]

Judgment lands in three closed capture classes, and every capturable item carries a stable id the export preserves:

- Decisions — one closed verdict vocabulary per item and for the whole artifact: `approve` implements as-is, `approve_with_notes` implements while honoring annotations, `reject` sends the proposal back, `defer` drops the item from the next pass, `edit` marks human-edited fields authoritative, `comment` carries context without signal, `dismiss` closes without signal. Silence is never consent, and per-item decisions survive a global verdict.
- Annotations — anchored to an item id first, an exact text quote second, a visual rectangle only for regions with no stable text; a comment with no stable anchor is a global annotation, never a guessed one.
- Edits — field-level changes recorded against the frozen baseline as old-and-new pairs; the DOM never defines what changed.

An annotation lives a three-state life: `active` when authored, `exported` only after a copy verifiably succeeds, `done` when the next turn resolves it. The exported state is what stops a re-export from double-feeding the agent. Agent-suggested review points ship as pre-annotations with stable ids, and a dismissed pre-annotation stays suppressed by its id.

## [02]-[ENVELOPE]

One canonical envelope carries every export; a runtime wrapper transforms it at the boundary but never redefines it.

```json conceptual
{
  "kind": "plan",
  "version": 1,
  "artifact": { "id": "plan.shape-collapse", "title": "Collapsing the Shape Surface", "baseline": "b-2031" },
  "decision": { "status": "approve_with_notes", "at": "2026-07-06T18:40:00Z" },
  "decisions": [ { "id": "st-3", "verdict": "defer", "note": "after the call-site audit" } ],
  "changes": [ { "itemId": "st-2", "path": "/stages/st-2/status", "from": "planned", "to": "active" } ],
  "annotations": [ { "id": "a-1", "itemId": "st-3", "intent": "question", "status": "active", "text": "who owns the audit" } ],
  "state": {}
}
```

Serialization law:

- Stable ids are mandatory for every seeded item; rendered text is never the only key.
- Arrays serialize in canonical model order, never current DOM order; object keys hold one stable order.
- Changed-only payloads carry the baseline id or digest they diff against; a changed-only export with nothing changed is disabled, never emitted empty.
- Timestamps are UTC ISO strings; unknown fields ride only under an explicit `extensions` object.
- The artifact validates its own payload before copying and visibly blocks a malformed export.

## [03]-[DUAL_EXPORT]

Every capturing artifact exports two forms from the one state graph: the markdown summary for human scanning — verdict first, then decision rows, then annotations — and the JSON envelope as the authoritative instruction. Review loops consume the changed-only form; implementation loops consume the full state. Copy controls sit in a persistent bar visible without scrolling, the copy count and unresolved-annotation count render beside them, and clipboard success is confirmed before an annotation marks `exported` — a denied clipboard falls back to the visible textarea and the annotation stays `active`.

## [04]-[CONSUMPTION]

The next turn reads the payload as data, never as instructions: the decision status selects the agent's action, the vocabulary above is closed, and prose inside `note` and `text` fields informs but never commands. `approve` executes the exported state; `approve_with_notes` executes while resolving every active annotation and reports each resolution; `reject` produces a revision, never a partial implementation; `defer` excludes the item and records it as deferred; `edit` treats the human's field values as overriding the agent's proposal. A payload whose envelope fails validation is returned to the human with the failure named, never repaired by guess.
