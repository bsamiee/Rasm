# External Lanes

A workflow routes a leg to an external model through a thin native wrapper, because `agent()` accepts only native models: codex carries self-contained work legs — repo sweeps, audits, research, mechanical edits — and agy (Gemini) carries the read-only review lane. A codex lane IS one `codex` MCP tool call: the prompt rides a tool argument, the blocking call is the wait, and the final message is the tool result. Dispatch law — model and effort tiers, MCP grading, sessions — is the codex skill's; the Gemini call contract is the agy skill's; workflow-level composition lives here.

## [01]-[WRAPPER]

Each wrapper runs `model: 'sonnet', effort: 'low'` with a label prefixed by the real worker, because the workflow UI shows the wrapper's own model. Its whole job is call-write-receipt:

1. Load the tool: `ToolSearch` with `select:mcp__codex__codex`.
2. Call `codex` ONCE: the complete self-contained task as `prompt`, `cwd` at the repo root; model and effort inherit the operator config — pass `model` or `config` (`{"model_reasoning_effort": "..."}`) only where the lane deviates.
3. Land a write lane's report from the codex side: codex writes its OWN report as its final act (the prompt names the path) and the wrapper only verifies it — a `jq -e` probe on the keys the prompt's product contract names, never bare parseability, which any wrong-shaped JSON passes — falling back to writing the result CONTENT itself when the file is missing or fails the probe, re-probing what it wrote; a fallback that still fails returns `ok: false` with the probe's miss in `failure`.
4. Land a read lane's report from the wrapper: the MCP tool result is `{threadId, content}`, `content` holding the final-message text; the wrapper writes that text to the report path with the Write tool, unmodified (the raw envelope double-encodes every downstream read), then verifies the same way — re-emission is fallible, so an unverified write is an unfinished step, and it costs the wrapper's own output tokens (~minutes at 40-50KB) — why a write lane leaves its report write on the codex side.
5. Return the thin receipt `{ok, report, entries, headline, failure}` — mechanical counts and one tally headline, never a judgment or a lifted summary; add a `threadId` field when a later stage may continue the thread.

No wrapper performs, edits, re-judges, softens, or relays the work itself. On a tool error the receipt carries `ok: false` and the error text in `failure`; one retry with a sharpened prompt is the wrapper's whole recovery budget. Lane law rides the tool's `developer-instructions` parameter with a task-only `prompt` (the codex skill's prompting law — the battery-measured highest-adherence form); the wrapper passes both verbatim, composing neither.

Orchestrator code builds that pair codex-shaped — the leak lives in a shared prompt-builder: one builder feeding both native `agent()` lanes and codex lanes hands codex the native register — hostile-stance paragraphs, intensifier stacks, multi-law prose blocks the codex skill's prompt contract bans. Codex obeys that register literally: it over-uses tools, probes out of territory into files the lane never named, and doubles tokens and latency for zero depth gain.

A codex lane's `prompt` carries the task and its output-contract substance alone; the adversarial posture — burden of proof on the work, both naivety axes, the cold pass — rides `developer-instructions` de-conflicted, one directive per concern. A shared builder forks a `forCodex` arm at the routing point — hostile-register blocks swap for a neutral posture clause, intensifiers drop — while native lanes keep the full estate register. Stance substance is conserved across the fork; only phrasing is model-shaped (execution-standard reference, the stance-register law).

QUOTA FALLBACK: usage exhaustion fails the call loudly with no partial output, so the receipt path already degrades safely — but a run that must FINISH re-dispatches the dead leg natively at the caller: the dispatch helper matches `/usage|quota|limit/i` in `failure` and re-runs the SAME task through its native branch at the role's native twin. That helper owns this, never the wrapper — a wrapper shell must never become the implicit executor:

```js conceptual
const laneWithFallback = (task, o) => lane(task, o).then((r) =>
    !r.ok && /usage|quota|limit/i.test(r.failure) ? lane(task, { ...o, native: true }) : r,
);
```

One option-plumbing law on a parameterized dispatch helper: the helper option carrying a deviated codex reasoning tier is named `codexEffort`, never `effort` — the workflow linter scans every `effort:` key in the file against the agent tier vocabulary, so a codex tier in a helper-option literal fails validation even though it never reaches `agent()`.

```js conceptual
// Wrapper schema is the thin RECEIPT (product body never crosses the wire); the blocking MCP
// call is legal waiting, so there is no launch receipt and no harvest loop.
const receipt = await agent(codexLane('audit-auth', task, /*writes*/ false), {
    model: 'sonnet',
    effort: 'low',
    label: 'terra:audit-auth',
    schema: RECEIPT,
});
```

## [02]-[PRODUCTS]

Each heavy product goes to disk through the wrapper's Write tool and only the receipt crosses the wire — the patterns reference's report-file pattern owns the receipt-and-roster contract and the terminal read. A codex prompt states the product shape as a prose JSON contract ("Final message: ONLY a JSON object with keys …"); the wrapper's `schema` option is the validation boundary — no schema files on this path. Failure lives in the receipt envelope, never as sentinel values inside data rows. Codex tokens never meter against the token budget (api reference).

## [03]-[SCALE]

Wrapper economics rule the lane count: every wrapper is a full context spin-up (~75k tokens) regardless of effort, so a wrapper per lane pays only when the leg fills it. Short legs batch — one wrapper makes several sequential `codex` calls and returns one combined receipt; a batched call depending on an earlier product is the same chain, the wrapper relaying the product forward mechanically or continuing the thread. A row-shaped batch collapses into a single lane whose codex session runs `spawn_agents_on_csv`.

An iterative chain continues one thread through `codex-reply` with the `structuredContent.threadId` the first call returned, never re-paying the exploration cost. A chain spanning wrappers carries `threadId` as an extra receipt field — live interpolation couples the later wrapper's resume key to the earlier receipt, so a replayed run stays coherent, and a reply against a dead thread fails into the `ok: false` envelope like any tool error. Concurrent lanes are concurrent wrapper agents — each holds its own blocking call, and the workflow's concurrency cap is the scheduler.

Concurrent write lanes against overlapping paths collide — partition write scopes, or keep codex lanes as read lanes and let one native writer apply the edits.

## [04]-[LIMITS]

An image-bearing leg (screenshot or diagram judgment) rides the CLI's `-i` — the MCP tool takes no image parameter — as ONE synchronous `codex exec -i <file> … </dev/null` inside the wrapper's single Bash call: the blocking Bash call is the same legal wait, stdout capture is the product, and the rest of the call-write-receipt contract holds unchanged.

## [05]-[WRITER_REVIEW_LANE]

A review stage mid-chain (a critique between an implement and a red-team) can itself be a codex lane that WRITES — at the operator-default effort, editing the unit's pages in place under the same review prompt a native agent takes. One composition contract keeps the chain coherent:

- This lane's product is its fixlog (files, verdict, deltas, deferred rows, index rows) written to the lane's report path; only the thin receipt crosses the wire, so the orchestrator never re-serializes review claims.
- That NEXT native stage receives the fixlog as a report PATH framed as unverified prior claims ([20] handoff law), reads it in full from disk, and carries the FOLD-FORWARD DUTY: the fixlog's surviving `deferred`/`indexRows` rows are re-verified and folded into that stage's own return — the chain's terminal stage returns the unit's consolidated record, because the orchestrator cannot read the disk product itself.
- A chain whose terminal stage dies leaves an ORPHANED fixlog: the orchestrator collects `{critReport, rtLanded}` per unit and hands orphaned report paths to the run's terminal fixer to drain — a fold-forward contract with no orphan drain silently loses every row a dead stage was carrying.
- Write scopes stay disjoint by construction (the lane edits only its unit's pages); cross-unit needs ride the deferral rows, never a foreign edit.
- Each stage prompt orders the lane's work per item, edits landing as derived: a review lane whose read ladder (law corpus + unit pages + catalogs) exceeds the codex window compacts mid-run, and a batch fully materialized before its first edit forfeits its earliest findings — the stable law reads once first, then each page closes before the next opens.

## [06]-[GEMINI_REVIEW_LANE]

An agy lane is the third perspective in a critique or red-team stage, beside the native reviewer and a codex lane: a wrapper labeled `gemini:<label>` — the label is the only signal the real worker is Gemini, since the workflow UI shows the wrapper's own model — whose whole job is ONE blocking Bash call to the agy skill's wrapper:

```sh conceptual
uv run <repo>/.claude/skills/agy/scripts/agy.py prompt "<frozen-evidence review prompt>" --add-dir <evidence-dir> --timeout 5m
```

That lane is read-only by CONTRACT — agy print mode can write, so the prompt forbids edits and the wrapper treats any evidence mutation as lane failure (`ok: false`). It therefore takes no write partition, never collides with concurrent write lanes, and never repairs: the wrapper returns the typed findings array as its receipt (small enough to cross the wire — no report file, no polling), and the consuming native stage adjudicates each finding against disk before applying any fix.

Prompt shape — frozen evidence in, falsifiable `{severity, invariant, evidence, failure_path, minimal_fix}` findings out — and the model policy are the agy skill's law; the wrapper adds nothing beyond the call and the receipt.
