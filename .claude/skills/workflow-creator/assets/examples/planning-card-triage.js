/**
 * planning-card-triage — realize the open planning cards that matter most.
 *
 * Each Rasm package owns a pool of IDEAS/TASK cards under its `.planning/`. This
 * pulls the open cards for a scope, keeps only those at or above a priority
 * threshold (default 'high'), then realizes and verifies each one. The threshold
 * filter is one line of ordinary JavaScript between the two agent stages.
 *
 * Workflow({ name: 'planning-card-triage',
 *            args: { scope: 'libs/csharp/Rasm.Bim', minPriority: 'high' } })
