    Local code review through three engines — CodeRabbit (working tree), Greptile (committed
    commits vs base), Macroscope (in-place AST correctness) — driven by one verb rail
    (`launch`, `status --follow`, `kill`, `findings --normalize`, `slice`, `reconcile`,
    `harvest`, `gather`, `round`, `verify`, `selftest`) through the COLLECT -> FIX -> DISPOSITION ->
    DISTILL cycle, with per-reviewer concurrent rounds, cross-engine `gather` union, per-round
    `--focus` aiming, fixer-lane dispatch under the shipped lane-law template, and distillation
    through the reviewer-harvest agent into the `.coderabbit.yaml`, `.greptile/`, and
    `.macroscope/` reviewer-config surfaces. Trigger on any explicit review request,
    autonomously when a review is warranted (code, quality, security), on "run coderabbit",
    "run greptile", or "run macroscope", and when tuning any reviewer config. Hosted PR
    reviewer round-trips belong to pr-loop.

# [CODE_REVIEW]

One rail folds CodeRabbit, Greptile, and Macroscope into a single improvement machine: it launches, watches, and harvests each into one normalized finding schema, fixer lanes drain the findings under the shipped lane-law template, and each round distills refuted classes and lessons into the reviewer configs so the next round runs harder.

## [01]-[ROUTING]

[REFERENCES]:
- [01]-[CODERABBIT](references/coderabbit.md): `.coderabbit.yaml` config, the `--agent` stream, and the rich finding store
- [02]-[GREPTILE](references/greptile.md): `.greptile/` cascade, the `--json` envelope and status oracle, and the MCP bridge
- [03]-[MACROSCOPE](references/macroscope.md): `.macroscope/` concern files, the stream grammar, and worktree custody

[TEMPLATES]: the prompt templates are disjoint; a fact appearing in two of them is a defect.
- [01]-[LANE_LAW](templates/lane-law.md): fixer conduct law the dispatch owner carries verbatim
- [02]-[CODEX_LANE](templates/codex-lane.md): channel-split codex dispatch form — launch, task message, spawn health and audit
- [03]-[FABLE_LANE](templates/fable-lane.md): single-prompt Agent-tool dispatch form — self-mined census, report custody, return shape
- [04]-[HARVEST_DISPATCH](templates/harvest-dispatch.md): per-round reviewer-harvest prompt — round-instance slots alone
- [05]-[CLOSER_DISPATCH](templates/closer-dispatch.md): routed-row closer prompt — sizing, arming, land-or-refute stance
- [06]-[REFUTED_CLASSES](templates/refuted-classes.yaml): refuted-class registry driving the classifier, recurrence detector, and corpus-matched roster

[SCRIPTS]:
- [01]-[REVIEW_RAIL](scripts/review_rail.py): verb rail printing one JSON receipt per verb

[AGENT]:
- `reviewer-harvest`: owns the DISTILL leg, dispatched via the Agent tool from `[05]`; its standing law lives in its own system prompt

## [02]-[CYCLE]

Every round runs COLLECT -> FIX -> DISPOSITION -> DISTILL on two custody lanes that never mix: work under review stays uncommitted or on its slice commits, while distillation — reviewer configs, `docs/`, `tools/` — commits and pushes to origin's default branch the moment it lands, because hosted engines read the indexed default branch and an unpushed guard protects nothing. Steps run in order; each carries what to watch and the knob that tunes it.

1. [CUSTODY]: commit non-review surfaces first — reviewer configs, `docs/`, `tools/`, `.claude/` infra — so the review scope holds exactly the work under review. WATCH: a reviewed-work file in the custody commit shrinks the next round's scope silently. KNOB: the commit-scope roster.
2. [LAUNCH]: `launch` per engine at its canonical scope ([03]), then run the receipt's `watch_cmd` through Bash `run_in_background`. Every diff-scoped engine shares one blind spot — an untouched file never enters review — so an estate round also runs the fleet-scope collectors beside the engines: `estate_audit.py` over the full skill and agent roots, its rows joining the round's finding pool as orchestrator-seeded lane rows. WATCH: the liveness line — `alive=yes` with a counting-down budget is healthy on blind engines. KNOB: engine choice and `--focus`.
3. [NORMALIZE]: `findings --normalize` per completed round; `gather` unions concurrent engines; `findings --digest` is the post-normalize read and the query filters answer targeted inspections — never hand-jq over findings.json. WATCH: the provenance histogram before any count judgment — a flat total decomposes into `relitigation|refuted_remint|new_work|late_discovery` before any config takes blame, and rising new-work beside falling relitigation is convergence. KNOB: `--dedup-against`.
4. [SLICE]: `slice --lanes N` into balanced per-lane manifests, each with its dispatch-ready `lane-<letter>-brief.md`. WATCH: severity and folder balance across lanes. KNOB: lane count — small slices direct freed capacity into capability depth, never early finish.
5. [FIX]: one keeper per lane under the model's dispatch form — `templates/codex-lane.md` for codex, `templates/fable-lane.md` for fable; the lane brief arms the prompt, and each lane returns only its report path, so report bodies never enter the orchestrator's context. WATCH: codex — stderr banner within a minute, spawn audit against the parent rollout per the dispatch form; fable — the report on disk at return. KNOB: model tier and lane-law wording — sharpen by replacement, never accumulate.
6. [RECONCILE]: `reconcile` proves per-lane id bijection and emits the verdict histogram. WATCH: verdict-mix honesty — fixed-versus-upgraded inflation, citation-backed push-back share. KNOB: a dropped finding closes through one focused opus closer armed with the slice's stack doctrine, never a session resume.
7. [CLOSERS]: routing rows drain concurrently over disjoint territories under `templates/closer-dispatch.md` — opus for small single-file work, one fable with stacks arming for family or design work. WATCH: honest land-versus-refute — a mined candidate that cannot ground is refuted with its citation, never forced. KNOB: closer sizing.
8. [DISTILL]: `harvest` assembles the feed and memory proposals; dispatch the reviewer-harvest agent under `templates/harvest-dispatch.md`. WATCH: diff-sample the touched blocks — density rose (fewer words, same law), integrations weave rather than append, additions passed the earn test; the ledger's `trimmed` self-report verifies against the actual diff, never trusted alone. KNOB: the agent file — the single versioned tuning surface.
9. [VERIFY]: project the agent's ledger into `<round-dir>/surface-ledger.json` ([05]), then `verify --round N` proves each guard in its surface's own oracle. WATCH: an ineffective row marks failed wording — harden the owner, never re-skip. KNOB: `templates/refuted-classes.yaml` rows.
10. [CLOSE]: commit and push the distillation lane, then `round` appends the `rounds.jsonl` row and prints the round-over-round delta; a zero-findings round arrives here straight from normalize and closes clean, and round grades, engine verdicts, and refuted-class calibrations land on the campaign memory (`project_cr_review_cycle_machine`) — orchestrator-curated under the harness-steering mining law, adjudicated rows merged into the owning verdict, never per-round narration. WATCH: findings trending down while capability rows rise is the goal line. KNOB: none — the ledger is the sole progress instrument.
11. [NEXT]: grade the round on the [GRADING] axes, then pick the next engine — recurrence judges per engine, counts flattening under one engine rotate the next round to another, and `--focus` aims a round within one: greptile rides early rounds while the accumulated diff fits its size caps, coderabbit carries breadth at any diff size, macroscope joins whenever its lane is open. WATCH: plateau under a hardened config. KNOB: rotation and focus.

- [FRAMING]: both framings ride every surface — negative framing kills false-positive classes through do-not-flag guards citing the refuting ruling, positive framing steers toward house demands through hunt axes and hit-shape rosters. Hit-shape rosters land on every surface regardless of what an engine emits, because fixer miners execute them — the flywheel: fixer discoveries become next-round hit-shapes.
- [GRADING]: REVIEW-THE-REVIEWER grades every round on the round row's typed axis fields — `fp_share`, `relitigation_share`, `novel_quality` (accepted-verdict share over novel-provenance rows), `hunt_axis_fire` (per-axis fire counts) — ledger-recorded so config changes read before-and-after mechanically. Standing verdict: CodeRabbit emits no missing-capability findings under any `path_instructions` wording — capability-direction rides Macroscope check-run agents and Greptile structured rules.
    - Finding strength scores a per-round sample 0-4: anchored (file plus non-zero range, rail-stamped), actionable (repair direction, rail-stamped), discriminating (the claim states why the shape is wrong), novel (no adjudicated-class relitigation); a sub-2 mean marks a noise lane.
    - Fixer lanes grade on five axes per model from the round row's `by_model` rollup — depth-of-fix (upgraded over fixed plus upgraded), scope discipline (phantom-clean, routing-honest), refute quality (citation-backed push-backs), gate cleanliness (`gate_clean`), verdict-mix honesty (id bijection, upgraded claims surviving diff re-read) — so the fable-versus-sol comparison is one jq group.
    - Grades drive the tuning loop: a template, profile, or config edit lands between rounds and logs against the round it precedes, so the next round's delta reads as prompt-change to behavior-change mechanically. Grades stay truthful — an inflated grade poisons the attribution, and a competent-but-unremarkable lane grades exactly that; a depth shortfall tunes the dispatch template's mandate, never the grade.
    - Prose FP classes live as `corpus: prose` registry rows citing the docgen defect catalog, graded by the same recurrence machinery.

## [03]-[USAGE]

```bash template
RAIL="uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review_rail.py"
$RAIL launch --reviewer <engine> --scope <scope> [--focus <text-or-file>]   # receipt: round N, pgid, watch_cmd
# run the receipt's watch_cmd through Bash run_in_background; its exit re-invokes the agent
$RAIL status --follow --round <N>
$RAIL findings --normalize --round <N> [--dedup-against <M>]
$RAIL findings --digest --round <N>
$RAIL findings --file '<glob>' --severity <floor> --claim '<regex>' --round <N> [--json]
$RAIL slice --lanes 3 --round <N>
# fixer lanes run here (orchestrator dispatch): each prompt cites its lane-<letter>-brief.md; each lane writes <round-dir>/lane-<letter>-report.json
$RAIL reconcile --round <N>
$RAIL harvest --round <N>
# dispatch the reviewer-harvest agent on the feed; persist its ledger as <round-dir>/surface-ledger.json
$RAIL verify --round <N>

```

```bash template
$RAIL launch --reviewer coderabbit --scope uncommitted
$RAIL launch --reviewer greptile --scope base:<prior-boundary>
$RAIL launch --reviewer macroscope --scope base:<default-branch>
$RAIL status --follow --all-live            # run_in_background; exits when every live round is terminal
$RAIL findings --normalize --round <N>      # once per engine round
$RAIL gather --all-live                     # union round: fingerprint collapse, corroborators, max severity
# slice / reconcile / harvest / verify / round then target the gather round
```

Every verb accepts `--round N` and `--dir` and prints one JSON receipt; a refusal exits nonzero carrying `{code, detail}`. `launch` refuses an unsupported engine-scope pair and a live same-engine round loudly; the scope family is `all|committed|uncommitted|base:<ref>|base-commit:<sha>`, and the `--reviewer` selectors on `status`/`kill`/`gather` also take `cr|gt|ms`. `--focus` takes inline text or a file path — greptile rides `--instructions`, coderabbit a round-scoped `-c` instruction file, and macroscope refuses focus loudly because config files are its only steering.

Engine scope selection; each reference owns its engine's mechanics — base resolution, size gating, language routing, and config surface.

- [CODERABBIT]: sweeps working-tree quality and style at full breadth every run — a retry re-spends quota; canonical round `--scope uncommitted`, full scope family accepted. `launch` resolves and injects a base for every working-tree scope, refusing with the persist remedy when none resolves, since the engine otherwise fails within a second while exiting 0. `--light` is the cheap post-fix re-review lever, coderabbit-only.
- [GREPTILE]: hunts cross-file logic over committed commits against a base; canonical round `--scope base:<prior-boundary>` after committing the slice, `committed` reviews against the repo default, and `base:`/`base-commit:` refs take any committish. Scope is a base..HEAD range, so a cumulative campaign pins one base — `base-commit:<campaign-boundary>` held across rounds — and the whole accumulated delta reviews as one change regardless of commit count, with cross-round dedup and provenance keeping adjudicated rows out of lanes; local commits suffice for the CLI review, and a later push carries them to origin. A quota-free client-side preflight refuses an oversized range instantly — the pin holds until the caps refuse, then the campaign falls back to slice commits at the prior boundary. `--resume` and `--include` are greptile-only passthroughs.
- [MACROSCOPE]: streams AST-level correctness in place; canonical round `--scope base:<default-branch>` spanning committed branch work plus uncommitted edits, `uncommitted` for tree-only — an in-place run without a base on a branch reviews almost nothing. Always in place — fixes land in the files the review read — and `launch` preflight-sweeps stray review worktrees. Config files are its only steering channel.

Waiting is one mechanic: run the launch receipt's `watch_cmd` through Bash `run_in_background` — never foreground, never a per-turn `status` poll. Its loop prints a liveness line about every minute (phase, elapsed, alive, budget, findings seen) and self-exits at the terminal phase. Blind engines — greptile and macroscope — stream nothing between launch and the terminal dump: quiet is healthy, `alive=yes` with a counting-down `budget_s` is the health read, and the deadline is the sole timeout; the keepalive engine, coderabbit, also converts heartbeat silence past its grace to `stalled`. Terminal phases are `completed|failed|refused|stalled|timed-out|killed` — a terminal receipt short of `completed` names its fault `signature`, the `remedy`, and the engine `exit_code` — and `status --follow --all-live` exits 0 only when every followed round completed.

Bare `status` resolves the single live round, else the highest-numbered on disk; several live rounds refuse `ambiguous` naming them — pass `--round`, `--reviewer`, or `--all-live`. `kill` (same selectors) escalates SIGTERM to SIGKILL over the process group, sweeps detached survivors and macroscope worktrees, and reaps a wedged stalled or timed-out round whose engine still breathes; it refuses only a gather round (`no-process`) and a round whose process group is truly gone (`already-closed`).

`findings --normalize` gates on terminal phase `completed` and refuses an already-sliced round; cross-round dedup runs by default against the latest prior round carrying lane reports, `--dedup-against N` pins the pool, and dropped fingerprints leave after the provenance histogram (`relitigation|refuted_remint|new_work|late_discovery`, stamped against that prior round's ledger) computes over the full set, so relitigation still surfaces while lanes never re-fix adjudicated rows; `scope_misfire` on the receipt flags zero rows over a dirty scope, and an exit-0 zero-comment envelope over a clean scope is ordinary success. Normalize refuses `dedup-collapse` when over half of eight-plus admitted rows fold to one fingerprint pool — engine format drift, never real duplication — and the receipt carries `admitted` and `collapse_ratio` beside survivors. Bare `findings` reprints the summary receipt from disk; `--digest [--top N]` prints the round read — severity histogram, adaptive folder distribution, anchored/actionable shares, refuted-class census with matched ids, provenance, top findings per severity — and `--file <glob>`, `--severity <floor>`, `--claim <regex>` filter the normalized set as a query, composable with `--digest`; digest and query print human-scan text, `--json` the typed form. `gather` takes exactly one of `--all-live` (every open engine round), `--reviewer cr,gt,ms`, or `--rounds 1,2,3`, and every source must be `completed` and normalized.

`slice --lanes N --balance count|loc` partitions by adaptive folder affinity — grouping deepens past common path prefixes and splits oversized folders at their sub-folder seams until the requested lanes balance, so N lanes over at least N findings always cut N non-degenerate lanes; it clears stale lane files and briefs, stamps round-scoped ids, and emits per-lane manifests carrying the corpus-matched settled-rulings roster plus a dispatch-ready `lane-<letter>-brief.md` (file roster, per-file findings with claims and fix instructions) whose path the manifest carries — a registry row tagged `corpus` slices only into lanes whose file set resolves to that corpus. `reconcile` covers all lanes bare (`--all` is the explicit synonym; a named lane plus `--all` refuses). `round` refuses a duplicate close, fails loud on findings without lane reports, and closes a zero-findings round clean. `verify` takes exactly one of `--rule <text> [--path <file>]` (greptile cascade check) or `--round N` (all-surface ledger check). `selftest` proves the lane-report decode contract against the rail's shipped maximal-shape fixture — every report field populated beside the all-null variant — and exits nonzero naming each failed proof.

- [KEEPERS]: fix waves ride the model's dispatch form up to 12 lanes sliced by folder ownership, one keeper each; fable runs the distill and opus the focused closers.

## [04]-[LANE_CONTRACT]

Fixer-lane doctrine lives in `templates/lane-law.md`; each lane's report is the machine intake `reconcile`, `harvest`, and the reviewer-harvest agent parse, written to `<round-dir>/lane-<letter>-report.json` as the lane's final act:

```json signature
{
  "ledger": [{"id": "", "file": "", "severity": "", "verdict": "fixed|upgraded|pushed-back|already_resolved", "note": ""}],
  "improvements": [{"page": "", "pattern": "", "what": "", "axis": ""}],
  "refuted": [{"claim": "", "evidence": ""}],
  "capability": [],
  "routing": [],
  "uncertain": [],
  "gate_clean": true,
  "model": "",
  "wall_s": 0.0
}
```

`axis` is fixer-stamped hunt-axis metadata, never inferred; `capability`/`routing`/`uncertain` rows are free-shape JSON the harvest feed reprints; `gate_clean` records the final batched format-gate run over the lane's touched files.

## [05]-[DISTILL]

Reviewer-harvest owns the distill leg: dispatch it via `Agent(subagent_type: "reviewer-harvest")` under the `templates/harvest-dispatch.md` prompt, and it returns a typed surface ledger. Round dirs sit outside the agent's write territory, so project its landed guards into `<round-dir>/surface-ledger.json` yourself as `[{surface, text, path}]` rows — `surface` an engine name or alias, `text` the guard substring, `path` blank falling to `.coderabbit.yaml` for coderabbit and the repo-wide cascade for greptile, while a macroscope row names its topic file relative to `.macroscope/` — then `verify --round N` proves each row effective in its surface's own oracle.

- [REGISTRY]: `templates/refuted-classes.yaml` rows compile into the claim classifier, the recurrence detector, and the settled-rulings roster sliced into lane manifests by `corpus` tag; `harvest` proposes new rows in the feed, and a landed row is edited in the yaml, never in the script.
- [RAIL_GAPS]: a rail gap a round exposes lands on the rail's own script and data surfaces.
- [VERIFY]: `verify --round` re-proves each landed guard — a `.coderabbit.yaml` `path_instructions` clause by text, a greptile rule by substring over the resolved `greptile config` output (never by id — org rules re-key to server UUIDs) falling back to full-text over `.greptile/config.json` and `.greptile/rules.md` when the cascade truncates or a scoped rule never resolves at the probe path, the receipt `source` naming the oracle that matched, a macroscope topic file by presence and content.
- [FEED_OUTPUTS]: provenance and corroboration histograms feed review-the-reviewer — a class one engine raises and rounds keep refuting marks that engine's false-positive tendency, and multi-engine corroboration marks high-confidence work.
- [PROPOSALS]: `memory-proposals/` under the round dir carries candidate memory files the orchestrator curates, never the live memory dir — the campaign memory (`project_cr_review_cycle_machine`) is the destination owner, and a proposal duplicating a repo-owned fact dies at curation; the feed's `[GUARD_INEFFECTIVE]` section names classes recurring despite landed guards.

## [06]-[NON_GOALS]

- Rail territory ends at manifests and feeds — fixer dispatch belongs to the orchestrator, which judges slicing, models, and prompts.
- Watchers arm per round and die at terminal; no standing watcher, daemon, or per-event hook.
- Cross-reviewer merge stops at fingerprint dedup and the corroborator record — two engines disagreeing is signal, never noise to reconcile silently.
- `rounds.jsonl` is the health readout and the row-to-row delta the only progress instrument — jsonl and jq, never a dashboard.
