description: >-
    Author structural code patterns for the assay `code` rail — ast-grep
    metavariable patterns (`$VAR`, `$$$ARGS`) via `code search` and tree-sitter
    S-expression queries via `code query`. Use when matching code by AST shape
    rather than text, finding call/usage/definition patterns across
    C#/Python/TypeScript, or authoring a structural query before a repo-wide scan.

# [AST_GREP]

Structural search is authored for the `assay code` rail, which vendors ast-grep and tree-sitter in-process — never the raw `ast-grep`/`sg` CLI. Every pattern runs through `uv run python -m tools.assay code search|query` and returns the same one-`Envelope`, artifact-backed contract as every other rail. Vendoring pins the ast-grep version in the pnpm catalog (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` `@ast-grep/cli`) and resolves it through the lockfile; there is no globally installed CLI to match.

|  [02]   | Literal text occurrence                                                 | `code search --pattern <text>` (routes to ripgrep)           |
|  [03]   | Code by AST shape / metavariables                                       | `code search --pattern '$A.m($$$ARGS)'` (routes to ast-grep) |
|  [04]   | Precise node-kind / field query                                         | `code query --pattern '<tree-sitter S-expr>'`                |
|  [05]   | Symbol in an EXTERNAL compiled artifact (DLL, NuGet, py dist, `*.d.ts`) | `assay api`                                                  |

A literal `--pattern` routes to content search; the moment the pattern contains a `$NAME` metavariable it routes to ast-grep structural matching. Reach for `code` when plain single-symbol navigation is insufficient — arbitrary shapes, predicate-filtered captures, or a structural sweep.

## [02]-[AST_GREP_METAVARIABLES_CODE_SEARCH]

- `$NAME` — captures exactly one AST node. Names are UPPERCASE (`$A`, `$RECV`, `$COND`); a lowercase token is matched literally.
- `$$$NAME` — captures zero or more sibling nodes (argument lists, statement sequences, type parameters).
- Reusing a name enforces structural equality: `$A == $A` matches only when both nodes are identical, so `$A.foo($A)` finds self-passing calls.
- Every pattern must parse as valid code in the target grammar; put a metavariable wherever structure varies.
- Node kind matches, never whitespace or comments.
- Grammar is selected by flag: `--csharp | --python | --typescript`.

## [03]-[TREE_SITTER_QUERIES_CODE_QUERY]

For node-kind precision and field constraints, author a tree-sitter S-expression with `@captures` and predicates. Grammar-backed for `--python` and `--typescript`.

- Fields anchor structure: `(call_expression function: (identifier) @fn arguments: (arguments) @args)`.
- Predicates filter captures: `(#eq? @fn "run_check")`, `(#match? @name "^_")`.
- Content prefilter: one pattern with `#eq?`/`#any-of?` predicates alone skips files without the literal bytes pre-parse, at zero false negatives.
- A `#match?`/`#not-eq?` predicate, or multiple patterns, disables the prefilter and parses every routed file.
- Prefer literal `#eq?`/`#any-of?` over regex `#match?` for repo-wide scans where a literal anchor exists.

## [04]-[DISCIPLINE]

- Author against one known file first, confirm the shape, then widen the path set.
- AST matching is exact about node kind — a pattern matching nothing is usually a node-kind mismatch, not an absent target.
- Prefer the narrowest metavariable set that still generalizes; over-broad `$$$` swallows unintended siblings.
- Authoring is read/match only: assay's mutation rail (`static fix`) owns structural rewrite and formatter mutation; the native LSP tool is read-only.

## [05]-[EXAMPLES]

```bash copy-safe
# structural: every `<recv>.bar(...)` call in C#
uv run python -m tools.assay code search --pattern '$RECV.bar($$$ARGS)' --csharp src/

# structural: Python except-clause that only re-raises
uv run python -m tools.assay code search --pattern 'try:
    $$$BODY
except $E:
    raise' --python tools/

# tree-sitter: capture every Python function name
uv run python -m tools.assay code query --pattern '(function_definition name: (identifier) @name)' --python tools/

# tree-sitter: TypeScript call expressions to a bare identifier
uv run python -m tools.assay code query --pattern '(call_expression function: (identifier) @fn)' --typescript src/

# literal fallback (routes to ripgrep)
uv run python -m tools.assay code search --pattern run_check --python tools/assay

# NEGATIVE — wrong node kind, silently zero matches (not an error): `?.` parses as a distinct
# conditional-access node, so this skips every plain `recv.bar(...)`. An empty Envelope here means
# shape mismatch, not an absent target — re-author against `$RECV.bar($$$ARGS)`.
uv run python -m tools.assay code search --pattern '$RECV?.bar($$$ARGS)' --csharp src/
```
