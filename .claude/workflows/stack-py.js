    description:
        "Full-stack hardening of the docs/stacks/python CODE DOCTRINE — the standing python-stack harden engine (peer to stack-cs and stack-ts), run whenever to push the whole settled corpus (the core concept pages plus any sub-folder shard set present on disk) to the 13/10 ultra-dense bar. NOT a from-scratch build and NOT a restructure: the file set is settled and admits no new-page valve here — a structure decision routes through a rebuild campaign, never this harden (hence no Gate phase). Each FILE runs its own initial -> critique -> redteam pipeline; ALL files run concurrently under one pool cap — the chain is the file's own stage dependence, never a corpus barrier. Every stage is HOSTILE: the page is naive/shallow/illusory until it survives an aggressive attack, the burden of proof on the page. CRITIQUE is the mechanical line-by-line doctrinal-conformance audit (COLLAPSE_SCAN, OWNER_CHOOSER, KNOB_TEST, AOP, rails, py3.15/payloads, citation tier, agnostic snippet law, page-craft, altitude, zero-meta, capability-completeness) fixed in place; REDTEAM is critique AND MORE — counterfactual on the core teaching shape, anticipatory-collapse of the next case, corpus-wide duplication, AOP + shape-budget maximization, substrate-depth + phantoms, plus a full cold adversarial re-review. Critique and redteam read the LIVE corpus — the current on-disk state of every page, landed sibling hardening composed as found, a conflict resolved to the stronger form, never a revert — and edit ONLY their own file (the anti-collision rule among concurrent pipelines), reporting cross-file residuals. ONE terminal fable corpus agent then aligns cross-file seams, closes gaps, enforces the computation-law bodies, resolves every reported residual, and finalizes cold in one sweep. Every per-file stage and the corpus sweep carry a required-but-usually-empty harvest attestation RESTRICTED to reviewer/laws/constitution altitudes (the run authors docs/stacks/python, so a stacks lesson is already owned and never nominated); when the pooled nominations are non-empty, ONE terminal fable doctrine lander adjudicates them against docs/laws (refutation-first, land-nothing legal, never re-editing a docs/stacks/python page). The csharp doc set is the read-only FLOOR/reference; snippets agnostic; every cited member verified against the .api catalogs (novel members via assay api with its Context7/exa fallback); every edit scoped to docs/stacks/python.
