# [H1][VALIDATION]
>**Dictum:** *Operational criteria verify documentation standards compliance.*

<br>

Per-document-type checklists for auditing documentation artifacts. Use after creating, editing, or reviewing documentation. Items require agent judgment—no automated linter covers these.

---
## [1][README]
>**Dictum:** *Validation ensures README content matches project reality.*

<br>

- [ ] Title is single H1 matching project/package name.
- [ ] Description is one paragraph: what/why/distinction—no feature lists.
- [ ] Install commands are copy-pasteable and verified against current dependencies.
- [ ] Usage example is runnable: importable for libraries, `curl` for services, exact invocation for CLIs.
- [ ] Conditional sections included per project type (API for libraries, Architecture for services).
- [ ] Audience tiers progressively disclosed: evaluator, adopter, contributor.
- [ ] Architecture section shows system context, not implementation details.
- [ ] No class diagrams—component or container diagrams only.
- [ ] License section contains SPDX identifier and link to LICENSE file.
- [ ] No stale content: all referenced commands, paths, and versions match current state.

---
## [2][ADR]
>**Dictum:** *Decision records require structural completeness to preserve reasoning.*

<br>

- [ ] Title follows `ADR-NNNN: <Noun Phrase>`—sequential, four-digit.
- [ ] Status is exactly one of: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded, Rejected.
- [ ] Context contains verifiable facts—no narrative history, no opinion framing.
- [ ] Decision Drivers ranked by impact—each is named force.
- [ ] Minimum 2 Considered Options—each with explicit pros, cons, neutral impacts.
- [ ] "Do nothing" evaluated as option when status quo is viable.
- [ ] Decision Outcome references specific drivers justifying selection.
- [ ] Consequences section has all three categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral.
- [ ] Negative consequences are not omitted or minimized.
- [ ] Supersession backlinks are bidirectional (old → new, new → old).

---
## [3][CHANGELOG]
>**Dictum:** *Changelog entries must trace to verifiable project history.*

<br>

- [ ] Follows Keep Changelog format: Unreleased section at top.
- [ ] Entries grouped by: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.
- [ ] Version headings use semantic versioning: `[MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [ ] Entries describe user-facing impact—not internal implementation.
- [ ] No commit hashes or PR numbers in entry text (link separately if needed).
- [ ] Breaking changes highlighted under Changed or Removed with migration guidance.
- [ ] Security entries include CVE references when applicable.

---
## [4][CODE_DOCUMENTATION]
>**Dictum:** *Code documentation gates prevent type-restating noise.*

<br>

- [ ] All exported functions have doc comments: summary, params, returns.
- [ ] All exported types have summary with domain concept and invariants.
- [ ] Effect-returning functions document both success and failure channel semantics.
- [ ] Smart constructors document guard conditions, valid ranges, failure modes.
- [ ] Error types document each variant: trigger condition and caller response.
- [ ] Module-level doc comment states purpose in one line.
- [ ] No doc comment restates type signature (TYPE_RESTATING anti-pattern).
- [ ] No `@param` repeats parameter name as description (PARAMETER_NOISE anti-pattern).
- [ ] No inline comment describes WHAT—only WHY.
- [ ] No commented-out code in module.
- [ ] Language-specific format matches canonical standard: XML (C#), Google (Python), TSDoc (TS).

---
## [5][CONTRIBUTING]
>**Dictum:** *Contribution guides must enable autonomous contributor onboarding.*

<br>

- [ ] Development setup commands produce passing test suite from clean clone.
- [ ] Branch naming convention matches CI enforcement.
- [ ] Commit convention matches changelog generation expectations.
- [ ] PR template structure matches code review evaluation criteria.
- [ ] Test commands and coverage thresholds match CI configuration.
- [ ] No aspirational workflow steps that CI does not enforce.

---
## [6][ARCHITECTURE]
>**Dictum:** *Architecture validation ensures structural completeness and diagram accuracy.*

<br>

- [ ] System Overview includes C4 Context diagram with external actors.
- [ ] High-Level Architecture shows 3-7 bounded contexts with directional data flow.
- [ ] All diagram edges carry protocol or interaction labels.
- [ ] Codemap reflects actual directory structure—no invented paths.
- [ ] Codemap limited to 2-3 levels of nesting depth.
- [ ] Key Design Decisions link to existing ADRs with Accepted status.
- [ ] Cross-Cutting Concerns document auth, error handling, logging, observability.
- [ ] No implementation details (class names, method signatures) in diagrams.
- [ ] Invariants are testable and consequence-linked.
- [ ] Diagrams use Mermaid syntax and render without errors.
