# [SETTINGS]

Settings are the enforcement and defaults layer: they bind regardless of what the model believes. Scope precedence runs managed, command line, local (`.claude/settings.local.json`), project (`.claude/settings.json`), user (`~/.claude/settings.json`).

Merge law follows the value shape: a scalar key takes the narrowest scope's value wholesale, array-valued keys — `permissions.allow`, `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`, `claudeMdExcludes` — concatenate and deduplicate across scopes, and per-key maps such as `enabledPlugins` consult each key independently. Two arrays break the rule: `fallbackModel` takes the highest-precedence file whole, and `availableModels` replaces only when a managed source defines it. Managed rows are immovable; files hot-reload except `model` and `outputStyle`.

## [01]-[PERMISSIONS]

Rules are `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)` strings evaluated deny, then ask, then allow — a deny row beats every allow at any scope. Working surface:

- [MODES]: `permissions.defaultMode` sets the session baseline — `default` (CLI alias `manual`), `acceptEdits`, `auto` (a background classifier reviews commands; honored only from user or managed scope), `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`. `disableBypassPermissionsMode: "disable"` removes the bypass escape hatch at managed scope.
- [TERRITORY]: `permissions.additionalDirectories` extends the writable surface beyond the working directory — file access only, never configuration discovery. `Cd` rules bound `/cd`: a bare `Cd` deny disables it, `Cd(<path-pattern>)` blocks matching targets through every symlink spelling. Sandbox rows under `sandbox.*` bind filesystem, network, and credential reach beneath whatever permissions allow — schema in `guardrails.md`.
- [PROMPT_ECONOMY]: recurring prompts are a config smell — each session's repeated approvals convert into scoped allow rows, and destructive classes into deny rows, so unattended lanes (workflows, background workers, `-p` calls) run without a human at the prompt. Rows stay specifier-scoped; a blanket grant trades every future prompt for the whole tool surface:

    ```json rejected
    { "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash"] } }
    ```

    ```json accepted
    { "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(pnpm test:*)", "Bash(gh pr view:*)"], "deny": ["Bash(git push --force*:*)"] } }
    ```

## [02]-[MODEL_ROUTING]

`/model` switches mid-session; `--model` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` bind one launch; the `model` setting persists. Aliases track the current provider-selected version — a full model name pins one, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` and its per-alias siblings re-point what an alias resolves to, and `modelOverrides` adds or replaces picker rows. `opusplan` runs `opus` during plan mode and drops to `sonnet` for execution; `default` clears overrides. `availableModels` with `enforceAvailableModels` allowlists what any surface resolves to, and `fallbackModel` catches overload.

Two adjacent routing rows: `advisorModel` arms a second-model consult at key task moments (`/advisor`, `--advisor`; subagents inherit it), and `fastMode` trades cost for Opus speed (`/fast`), with `fastModePerSessionOptIn` resetting the choice each session from managed scope. Subagent resolution — `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`, per-invocation, frontmatter, inherited — lives with agent-dispatch.

## [03]-[EFFORT]

Effort binds adaptive reasoning per session: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` — availability model-dependent, an unsupported level falling to the highest supported one below it, and each model calibrating the scale so a level name is not comparable across models. Set through `/effort`, `--effort`, the persisted `effortLevel` setting, or `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`. `ultracode` is a harness mode, not a model level: it sends `xhigh` and plans a dynamic workflow for every substantive task, reachable only through `/effort ultracode` or `--effort ultracode`.

## [05]-[PLUGINS_AND_MCP]

`enabledPlugins` keys as `plugin@marketplace`; `extraKnownMarketplaces` admits GitHub, git, and directory sources; `strictKnownMarketplaces` and `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` lock fleets to vetted sources. Registration scope law, the plugin cache, and LSP plugin anatomy are `plugins.md`'s.

Project MCP servers declare in `.mcp.json` with approval governed by `enableAllProjectMcpServers`, `enabledMcpjsonServers`, and `disabledMcpjsonServers`; managed `allowedMcpServers` and `deniedMcpServers` bind every scope including subagent frontmatter, and user and local MCP state lives in `~/.claude.json`, outside the settings files. Two env rows are the context levers for MCP-heavy estates: `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` defers tool schemas behind ToolSearch, and `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` caps a single tool result.

## [06]-[INTERFACE]

- [KEYBINDINGS]: `~/.claude/keybindings.json` (`/keybindings` creates and opens it) carries a `bindings` array of per-context blocks — `Global`, `Chat`, `Autocomplete`, `Confirmation`, and kin — each mapping keystrokes to `namespace:action` values such as `chat:submit`; `null` unbinds, and edits hot-reload without restart.
- [STATUSLINE]: `statusLine` runs a command (`type: "command"`) with `refreshInterval`, `padding`, and `hideVimModeIndicator`, receiving session JSON on stdin and the terminal width in `COLUMNS`; `/statusline` generates a starting script.
- [OUTPUT_STYLES]: custom styles are `.md` files under `~/.claude/output-styles` or `.claude/output-styles` whose frontmatter carries `name`, `description`, and `keep-coding-instructions`; the style replaces the system-prompt register while memory, skills, and settings ride unchanged — set through `outputStyle` or `/config`.
