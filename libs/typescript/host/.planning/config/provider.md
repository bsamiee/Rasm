# [HOST_PROVIDER]

The provider chain is one composed value answering every `Config` read in the process: an ordered, non-empty tuple of source stages — process env (which is also where `doppler run` injection lands), dotenv file, file tree, remote document, literal table — folded left through `ConfigProvider.orElse` into one `ConfigProvider` and installed once as `Layer.setConfigProvider` beneath the whole graph. Precedence is the tuple order: the head answers first, each later stage answers only what every earlier stage missed. A source is a case of one closed `Stage` family, so a new source is one case plus one build arm, and the chain itself is app data — the host owns the fold, never a hardcoded source roster. `schema.md`'s `Setting` and every folder contract resolve against whatever chain the root installed; no reader knows or names its source.

## [1]-[INDEX]

- [01]-[STAGE_FAMILY]: the closed source vocabulary and the doppler-injection law.
- [02]-[CHAIN_FOLD]: the orElse fold, the skip-versus-fail construction law, and the one `Layer.setConfigProvider` install.

## [2]-[STAGE_FAMILY]

- Owner: `Provider.Stage` — one `Data.taggedEnum` family: `Env` (process environment), `DotEnv` carrying its file path, `Tree` carrying the mount root (the K8s secret-mount form — one file per key), `Remote` carrying the document origin, `Table` carrying a literal row map (the harness and inline-override form). Constructors ride the exported `Provider` owner, so declaring a chain is one import.
- Law: doppler is env — `doppler run --` injects leased secrets as process environment before the runtime boots, so the doppler stage IS the `Env` stage's content and holds env precedence; the chain never dials Doppler at runtime. The runtime Doppler axis — TTL-leased rotation, `Redacted` end to end — is `security/secret`'s owner; this chain's doppler posture is injection-only.
- Law: the remote stage is a boot-time document — fetched once at chain construction through the shared client, decoded as one JSON document, and served through `ConfigProvider.fromJson` under `ConfigProvider.constantCase` so a camelCase remote document answers the CONSTANT_CASE reads the rows declare; live re-evaluation is not a config concern — the one live remote surface is the flag feed (`../flag/verdict.md`), never a mutating config chain.
- Law: a stage carries data, not behavior — path, root, origin, rows are case payloads; the build arm owns the mechanics, so the chain declaration reads as policy.
- Boundary: proof pins ride the same family — `Table` under `ConfigProvider.fromMap` is the harness stage, composed at the head of a spec chain; a second override mechanism beside the family is the rejected form.
- Packages: `effect` (`ConfigProvider`, `Data`, `Match`), `@effect/platform` (`PlatformConfigProvider`, `HttpClient`, `HttpClientResponse`, `FileSystem`, `Path`).

## [3]-[CHAIN_FOLD]

- Owner: `Provider.chain` — the one entry: a `NonEmptyReadonlyArray<Stage>` folds to `Layer.Layer<never, …>` installing the composed provider. Each stage builds effectfully; the fold is `Array.reduce` over `ConfigProvider.orElse` with the head as seed, so precedence is structural and the empty chain is unspellable.
- Law: construction failure splits by stage nature — the file stages (`DotEnv`, `Tree`) fold construction absence to a skipped stage through `Effect.option`, because a dev-only file legitimately does not exist in prod; the `Remote` stage was declared to be answered, so its fetch or decode failure rides the layer's error channel and fails the boot at the root proof. `Env` and `Table` are total.
- Law: one install site — the returned `Layer<never>` merges once beneath the root; a second `setConfigProvider` at a deeper altitude shadows the root's chain and is the named defect. Requirements (`FileSystem`, `Path` for file stages; `HttpClient` for remote) are satisfied by the runtime row's context and the shared client, so the chain layer composes after the platform layer and before every config-reading service.
- Entry: `Provider.chain(stages)` at the app root; nothing else in the branch touches `ConfigProvider`.
- Receipt: the layer's stated annotation is the chain's contract — `Layer.Layer<never, HttpClientError | ParseError, HttpClient | FileSystem | Path>` — readable at the root without opening the fold.
- Packages: `effect` (`Array`, `Effect`, `Layer`, `Option`, `Schema`), `@effect/platform` as above.
