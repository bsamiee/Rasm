-- Pattern : A dispatch rail whose load-bearing verbs are chevron literals. Each row carries both a
--           raw-code send against a runtime-chosen target and the term send the dictionary compiled,
--           a probe elects one per verb, and an osadecompile census receipts terminology drift.
-- Run     : osascript chevron-dispatch.applescript [bundle-id]
use AppleScript version "2.8"
use scripting additions

-- A retired term still sends its compiled code and the target answers -1708 (event not handled) before any
-- work happens; object and coercion faults are domain failures owned by the rail that raised them.
property absentTerminology : {-1708}
property defaultBundleID : "com.apple.finder"

-- Every row owns the same send twice. The code half compiles with no dictionary resolution and holds a
-- runtime-chosen target, which resolves no terminology at all; the term half compiles only because a
-- literal target let the dictionary in at compile time, so it is the half an .sdef revision can retire.

	-- A rectangle crosses as four big-endian SInt16 fields, and the compiler coerces no list into that
	-- shape under a runtime-chosen target, so the payload rides as raw typeQDRectangle bytes.

			tell application "Finder" to set bounds of window 1 to {0, 0, 300, 200}

-- Terminology presence is a runtime property of the installed target, so the probe asks the term rail first
-- and elects the code rail on an absence fault alone. Any other fault is the domain's and stays attributed
-- to the rail that raised it, which keeps one verb's failure off the other rows.
