# Workflow Patterns

Copy-paste orchestration shapes. Each says when to use it, the primitive it rests
on, and the failure mode it guards — then gives runnable code. Match the pattern to
the Step 2 answers in `SKILL.md`: known list vs unknown count, one pass vs staged,
barrier needed or not.

JSON Schemas are shown abbreviated as `SCHEMA`; define real ones — see the bottom
of this file.

## The canonical map

The whole space is built from five primitives: `pipeline` (streaming stages, no
barrier), `parallel` (a barrier — waits for every thunk), a plain-JS loop, a bounded
worker pool, and the `agent()` leaf itself. The five canonical agent topologies are
each a concrete arrangement of those primitives — parallelization splits into its
sectioning and voting variants, so it occupies two rows below. Every shape in this
file is one of these topologies or a hardened specialization:

| Canonical topology | Primitive(s) | When it fits | Failure mode it guards |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt chaining** | `pipeline` (or a sequential `agent()` chain) | The task decomposes into fixed ordered subtasks, each consuming the last's output | A single overloaded call loses accuracy; each stage gets one clean job and context |
| **Parallelization — sectioning** | `parallel` barrier, or `pipeline` fan-out | Independent subtasks (per-file, per-dimension, per-question) run at once, then combine | Sequential wall-clock, and one call's divided focus diluting every aspect |
| **Parallelization — voting** | `parallel` barrier over N identical-input thunks | One judgement is high-stakes; you want agreement, not a lone verdict | A single confident-but-wrong answer surviving unchallenged |
| **Routing** | plain-JS discriminant → one `agent()` of many | Inputs fall into distinct classes each handled best by a different specialist | One generic prompt that is mediocre at every class; cross-class interference |
| **Orchestrator–workers** | planner `agent()` → `parallel`/`pipeline` over its output | The subtask list is *not known up front* — a planner must decompose first | Hardcoding a worklist the problem does not actually have |
| **Evaluator–optimizer** | plain-JS loop: generate `agent()` → evaluate `agent()` | There are clear pass criteria and one draft is rarely enough | Shipping a first pass; or a single agent grading its own work |

Two decision rules sit on top of this map. **Sectioning defaults to `pipeline`, not
`parallel`** — reach for the `parallel` barrier only when a stage needs the *entire*
previous result set at once (Step 3 in `SKILL.md`). **The evaluator is always a
separate `agent()` from the generator** — one agent grading its own output is the
self-correction anti-pattern and finds nothing.

---

## 1. Prompt chaining — fixed ordered stages

**Canonical:** prompt chaining. **Primitive:** `pipeline`. **Guards:** the accuracy
loss of one overloaded call by giving each subtask its own clean-context agent.

**When:** the work splits into a *fixed* sequence where each stage consumes the
previous stage's output — outline → draft → tighten, extract → normalize → validate.
One known list of items, each flowing the whole chain.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'spec-to-draft',
  description: 'Turn each spec section into an outline, then a draft, then a tightened pass',
  phases: [{ title: 'Outline' }, { title: 'Draft' }, { title: 'Tighten' }],
}

const sections = ['geometry kernel', 'mesh pipeline', 'IFC export']

const out = await pipeline(
  sections,
  s          => agent(`Outline the doc section for: ${s}. Return headings only.`,
                      { label: `outline:${s}`, phase: 'Outline', schema: OUTLINE_SCHEMA }),
  (outline, s) => agent(`Draft "${s}" from this outline:\n${JSON.stringify(outline)}`,
                        { label: `draft:${s}`, phase: 'Draft' }),
  (draft, s)   => agent(`Tighten this "${s}" draft — cut redundancy, keep every claim:\n${draft}`,
                        { label: `tighten:${s}`, phase: 'Tighten' }),
)

return { sections: out.filter(Boolean) }
```

A gate variant adds a JS check between stages — if an outline fails a cheap
structural test, the item can be dropped (`return null`) before paying for the draft.

---

## 2. Parallelization (sectioning) — fan-out then synthesize

**Canonical:** parallelization, sectioning variant. **Primitive:** `parallel`
barrier. **Guards:** sequential wall-clock, and the quality dilution of asking one
call to cover every angle. The synthesis genuinely needs every result, so the
barrier is correct here.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'research-fanout',
  description: 'Research independent questions in parallel, synthesize one report',
  phases: [{ title: 'Research' }, { title: 'Synthesize' }],
}

// `args` arrives as structured data — an array stays an array. Default the no-args run.
const questions = Array.isArray(args) && args.length ? args : ['demo question']

phase('Research')
const findings = await parallel(
  questions.map((q, i) => () =>
    agent(`Research and report verified facts:\n\n${q}`,
          { label: `q${i + 1}`, phase: 'Research', schema: RESEARCH_SCHEMA }))
)
const clean = findings
  .map((f, i) => (f ? { question: questions[i], ...f } : null))
  .filter(Boolean)

phase('Synthesize')
const report = await agent(
  'Combine the research below into one cohesive briefing; call out disagreements.\n\n'
  + JSON.stringify(clean, null, 2))

return { questionCount: clean.length, report }
```

---

## 3. Parallelization (sectioning) — pipeline: review then verify (the default multi-stage shape)

**Canonical:** prompt chaining ⋈ sectioning — staged work where each item also fans
out within a stage. **Primitive:** `pipeline` (with a nested `parallel` inside one
stage). **Guards:** the wasted idle time a barrier inflicts; each item should advance
the moment *it* is ready, no waiting for the slowest sibling. This is the default
multi-stage shape; prefer it over two `parallel()` calls with a barrier between them.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'review-and-verify',
  description: 'Review each dimension, verify each finding as soon as its review lands',
  phases: [{ title: 'Review' }, { title: 'Verify' }],
}

const DIMENSIONS = [
  { key: 'bugs', prompt: 'Find logic bugs in the changed files.' },
  { key: 'perf', prompt: 'Find performance regressions in the changed files.' },
]

const results = await pipeline(
  DIMENSIONS,
  d => agent(d.prompt, { label: `review:${d.key}`, phase: 'Review', schema: FINDINGS_SCHEMA }),
  review => parallel((review?.findings ?? []).map(f => () =>
    agent(`Adversarially verify: ${f.title}`,
          { label: `verify:${f.file}`, phase: 'Verify', schema: VERDICT_SCHEMA })
      .then(v => ({ ...f, verdict: v }))))
)

return { confirmed: results.flat().filter(Boolean).filter(f => f.verdict?.isReal) }
```

Dimension `bugs` verifies its findings while `perf` is still being reviewed.

---

## 4. Sectioning with a barrier — dedup before the next stage

**Canonical:** parallelization, sectioning. **Primitive:** `parallel` as a true
barrier. **Guards:** double work and wasted spend — the next stage needs the *entire*
previous result set in hand to dedup, merge, or early-exit on a count. This is the
legitimate use of `parallel` over a `pipeline`.

```js
const all = await parallel(
  DIMENSIONS.map(d => () => agent(d.prompt, { schema: FINDINGS_SCHEMA })))

const deduped = dedupeByFileAndLine(
  all.filter(Boolean).flatMap(r => r.findings))   // genuinely needs ALL at once

if (deduped.length === 0) return { confirmed: [], note: 'nothing to verify' }

const verified = await parallel(
  deduped.map(f => () => agent(verifyPrompt(f), { schema: VERDICT_SCHEMA })))
return { confirmed: verified.filter(Boolean).filter(v => v.isReal) }
```

---

## 5. Routing — discriminate, then dispatch one specialist

**Canonical:** routing. **Primitive:** a plain-JS discriminant choosing one `agent()`
from a table. **Guards:** the mediocrity of a single generic prompt forced to cover
every input class, and cross-class interference where tuning for one case hurts
another. The classifier may itself be an `agent()` when the class is not a simple key.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'route-fix',
  description: 'Classify each changed file by language, route it to the matching specialist',
  phases: [{ title: 'Classify' }, { title: 'Fix' }],
}

// One row per class: the discriminant value, the specialist prompt, and its model.
const ROUTES = {
  cs:  { prompt: f => `Refactor ${f} to LanguageExt ROP; collapse parallel types into a [Union].`, model: 'inherit' },
  ts:  { prompt: f => `Refactor ${f} to Effect-TS; replace throws with typed error channels.`,      model: 'inherit' },
  py:  { prompt: f => `Refactor ${f} to expression style; replace mutable accumulation with folds.`, model: 'inherit' },
  sql: { prompt: f => `Rewrite ${f} set-algebraically; push filters into the query.`,                model: 'haiku'   },
}
const classify = f => f.endsWith('.cs') ? 'cs' : f.endsWith('.ts') ? 'ts'
                    : f.endsWith('.py') ? 'py' : f.endsWith('.sql') ? 'sql' : null

phase('Fix')
const fixed = await parallel(changedFiles.map(f => () => {
  const route = ROUTES[classify(f)]
  return route ? agent(route.prompt(f), { label: `fix:${f}`, model: route.model }) : null
}))

return { fixed: fixed.filter(Boolean) }
```

The dispatch table is the pattern: adding a class is one row, never a new branch
threaded through the body. An unroutable input returns `null` and falls out at the
`.filter(Boolean)` rather than hitting a wrong specialist. The full worked file is
`assets/examples/route-and-refactor.js`.

---

## 6. Orchestrator–workers — a planner emits the worklist

**Canonical:** orchestrator–workers. **Primitive:** a planner `agent()` whose
structured output becomes the items a `parallel`/`pipeline` fans out over. **Guards:**
hardcoding a fixed worklist when the subtasks *cannot be known up front* — the set of
files to touch for a migration, the modules a feature spans, the questions a topic
raises. The orchestrator decides the breakdown at runtime; the workers execute it.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'migrate',
  description: 'Plan a migration into per-unit tasks, then run each unit, then integrate',
  phases: [{ title: 'Plan' }, { title: 'Work' }, { title: 'Integrate' }],
}

phase('Plan')
const plan = await agent(
  `Decompose this migration into independent units. One task per file or module that `
  + `can be changed on its own.\n\n${task}`,
  { label: 'orchestrator', schema: PLAN_SCHEMA })   // → { tasks: [{ id, file, instruction }] }

phase('Work')
const done = (await parallel((plan?.tasks ?? []).map(t => () =>
  agent(`${t.instruction}\n\nFile: ${t.file}`, { label: `work:${t.id}`, schema: WORK_SCHEMA })
    .then(r => ({ ...t, ...r })))
)).filter(Boolean)

phase('Integrate')
const integrated = await agent(
  'Integrate these independently-completed units; resolve any seam between them.\n\n'
  + JSON.stringify(done))
return { integrated, unitCount: done.length }
```

The planner returns DATA (a typed task list via `schema`), not prose — the JS fans
out over it. The integrator is the orchestrator's other half: workers cannot see each
other's context, so a terminal stage owns whatever spans them.

---

## 7. Evaluator–optimizer — generate, grade, iterate to a bar

**Canonical:** evaluator–optimizer. **Primitive:** a plain-JS loop wrapping a
generate `agent()` and a *separate* evaluate `agent()`. **Guards:** shipping a weak
first pass, and the self-correction anti-pattern — the evaluator MUST be a different
agent than the generator, or it rubber-stamps its own work. The pass verdict drives
the loop; a hard round cap stops it from looping forever on an unsatisfiable bar.

```js
const MAX_ROUNDS = 4
let draft = null
let feedback = ''

for (let round = 1; round <= MAX_ROUNDS; round++) {
  draft = await agent(
    `Implement the task. Address this feedback from the last attempt:\n${feedback || '(first attempt)'}`
    + `\n\nTask: ${task}`,
    { label: `attempt:${round}` })

  const review = await agent(                          // SEPARATE agent — never self-grade
    `Evaluate this attempt against the acceptance criteria. Be strict.\n\n${draft}`,
    { label: `evaluate:${round}`, schema: REVIEW_SCHEMA })   // → { passed, feedback }

  log(`round ${round}: ${review?.passed ? 'PASS' : 'revise'}`)
  if (review?.passed) return { draft, rounds: round }
  feedback = review?.feedback ?? ''
}
return { draft, rounds: MAX_ROUNDS, note: 'hit round cap without passing' }
```

---

## 8. Voting — adversarial verification (skeptic panel)

**Canonical:** parallelization, voting variant. **Primitive:** `parallel` over N
identical-input thunks. **Guards:** a single confident hallucination surviving — a
plausible-but-wrong finding that one verifier would wave through. Spawn N independent
skeptics, each told to *refute*; keep the finding only on a majority.

```js
async function survives(claim) {
  const votes = await parallel(Array.from({ length: 3 }, (_, i) => () =>
    agent(`Try hard to REFUTE this claim. Default to refuted=true if uncertain.\n\n${claim}`,
          { label: `skeptic:${i + 1}`, schema: VERDICT_SCHEMA })))
  return votes.filter(Boolean).filter(v => !v.refuted).length >= 2
}

const real = []
for (const f of candidateFindings) {
  if (await survives(f.title)) real.push(f)
}
return { real }
```

---

## 9. Voting + synthesis — judge panel (N attempts, score, combine)

**Canonical:** parallelization (voting) feeding sectioning. **Primitive:** `parallel`
to draft, `parallel` to score, one `agent()` to synthesize. **Guards:** the weakness
of one-attempt-then-iterate when the solution space is wide — independent attempts
from different angles, scored by parallel judges, then synthesized from the winner
while grafting the runners-up's best ideas.

```js
const ANGLES = ['MVP-first', 'risk-first', 'user-first', 'cost-first']

// `args` is structured data — a free-text task arrives as a string. Default the no-args run.
const idea = typeof args === 'string' && args.trim() ? args : 'the plan described in TASK.md'

phase('Draft')
const drafts = await parallel(ANGLES.map(a => () =>
  agent(`Produce a plan for: ${idea}. Take a strictly ${a} approach.`, { label: a })))

phase('Judge')
const scored = await parallel(drafts.filter(Boolean).map((d, i) => () =>
  agent(`Score this plan 1-10 for feasibility and impact. Return {score, why}.\n\n${d}`,
        { label: `judge:${i + 1}`, schema: SCORE_SCHEMA }).then(s => ({ draft: d, ...s }))))

const ranked = scored.filter(Boolean).sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)

phase('Synthesize')
const final = await agent(
  'Write the definitive plan. Base it on the WINNER, grafting the best ideas '
  + 'from the runners-up.\n\nWINNER:\n' + ranked[0].draft
  + '\n\nRUNNERS-UP:\n' + ranked.slice(1).map(r => r.draft).join('\n---\n'))
return { final }
```

---

## 10. Loop until a target count

**Canonical:** orchestrator–workers with an unknown count — the loop *is* the
orchestrator. **Primitive:** a plain-JS `while` with a counter. **Guards:** stopping
short on discovery work with a fixed goal ("find 10 bugs") — and running forever, via
the explicit count cap.

```js
const bugs = []
while (bugs.length < 10) {
  const r = await agent('Find bugs not already listed below.\n\n'
    + JSON.stringify(bugs.map(b => b.title)), { schema: BUGS_SCHEMA })
  bugs.push(...r.bugs)
  log(`${bugs.length}/10 found`)
}
return { bugs: bugs.slice(0, 10) }
```

---

## 11. Loop until the budget runs low

**Canonical:** orchestrator–workers scaled to a token target. **Primitive:** a
`while` guarded on `budget`. **Guards:** over- or under-spending — depth scales to the
user's token target. The `budget.total &&` guard is essential: without a target,
`remaining()` is `Infinity` and the loop runs to the 1000-agent cap.

```js
const issues = []
while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) {
  const r = await agent('Find one more issue in this codebase.', { schema: ISSUE_SCHEMA })
  issues.push(...r.issues)
  log(`${issues.length} found · ${Math.round(budget.remaining() / 1000)}k tokens left`)
}
return { issues }
```

---

## 12. Loop until dry (unknown-size discovery)

**Canonical:** orchestrator–workers, count unknown and unbounded. **Primitive:** a
`while` with a dry-streak counter and a hard cap. **Guards:** both halves of the
unknown-size trap — a fixed counter stops short of the long tail, and an open loop
never terminates. Keep spawning finders until K consecutive rounds turn up nothing
new.

```js
const seen = new Set()
const found = []
let dryRounds = 0

while (dryRounds < 2 && found.length < 100) {
  const r = await agent('Find issues NOT in this list:\n' + [...seen].join('\n'),
                        { schema: ISSUE_SCHEMA })
  const fresh = (r.issues ?? []).filter(x => !seen.has(x.id))
  fresh.forEach(x => { seen.add(x.id); found.push(x) })
  dryRounds = fresh.length === 0 ? dryRounds + 1 : 0
  log(`+${fresh.length} new · ${found.length} total · dry streak ${dryRounds}`)
}
return { found }
```

---

## 13. Fan-out then reconcile deferrals

**Canonical:** sectioning with a terminal orchestrator stage. **Primitive:**
`parallel` to fan out, a pure-JS barrier to cluster, `pipeline` to fix-and-verify each
cluster. **Guards:** the silent loss of cross-item work — each worker fixes what it
can alone but DEFERS work that spans items it does not own (a cross-file seam, a type
two siblings must share, a dangling reference). A plain fan-out collects those
deferrals and drops them: the exact class of fix that needs an owner is surfaced and
abandoned. The remedy is a terminal reconcile stage that consumes them.

The deferral must be DATA whose resource slot is a LIST, so a deferral spanning two
files names BOTH — that is the only thing that lets you cluster by shared resource.

```js
// per-worker schema: a residual carries a FILE LIST, not a free string
const FIX = { type: 'object', required: ['file'], properties: {
  file: { type: 'string' },
  residual: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'object', required: ['files', 'claim'],
    properties: { files: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } }, claim: { type: 'string' } } } } } }

const done = (await parallel(items.map(it => () => agent(workPrompt(it), { schema: FIX })))).filter(Boolean)

// BARRIER (pure JS, zero tokens): collect, dedup, cluster by connected file-set (union-find).
const all = done.flatMap(d => d.residual ?? [])
const uniq = [...new Map(all.map(r => [r.files.join(',') + '|' + r.claim, r])).values()]
const clusters = unionFindBySharedFile(uniq)   // residuals sharing any file land in one cluster

let hard = []
if (clusters.length) {                          // count-barrier early-exit (pattern #4)
  const out = await pipeline(                    // each disjoint cluster verifies the moment ITS fix lands
    clusters,
    cl       => agent('Fix these cross-file deferrals in place; read every listed file.\n' + JSON.stringify(cl), { schema: FIXED }),
    (fix, cl) => agent('Adversarially verify each claim is ACTUALLY resolved; read the files from disk. One verdict per claim.\n' + JSON.stringify(cl), { schema: VERIFY }).then(v => ({ cl, v })))
  hard = out.filter(Boolean).flatMap(o => (o.v?.claims ?? []).filter(c => !c.resolved).map(c => c.claim))
}
return { hard }                                  // only genuinely-unresolvable deferrals reach the human
```

Why each choice: disjoint clusters write non-overlapping files, so the per-cluster
fixers run concurrently with no collision — `isolation:'worktree'` is unnecessary.
The verifier is a SEPARATE agent (a single self-reviewing fixer is the
self-correction anti-pattern) handed the claims as a checklist, and the
one-verdict-per-claim schema is what proves completeness — a dropped claim cannot
validate. Distinct from #2 (synthesize into one report) and #8 (skeptic vote on one
claim): this is cluster-by-shared-resource, then fix-and-verify each cluster. The
full worked file is `assets/examples/rebuild-and-reconcile.js`.

---

## 14. Steady worker pool for a large list of long chains

**Canonical:** sectioning at scale. **Primitive:** a bounded worker pool over plain
`Promise.all`. **Guards:** the queue-flooding of `parallel(thunks)` when the list is
large (hundreds) and each item is a long multi-stage chain. `parallel` enqueues all N
at once and leans on the limiter to dequeue ~cap; a steady pool holds a true steady
state of ≤cap long chains, which is what you want when each chain runs for minutes.

```js
const pool = async (items, cap, worker) => {
  const out = new Array(items.length)
  let next = 0
  const run = async () => { while (next < items.length) { const i = next++; out[i] = await worker(items[i], i) } }
  await Promise.all(Array.from({ length: Math.min(cap, items.length) }, run))
  return out
}
const done = (await pool(pages, 14, p => processPage(p))).filter(Boolean)
```

`parallel()` is still correct for a small fixed fan-out that needs a barrier; reach
for the pool only for the large-corpus case `parallel()` does not serve as well. When
the pool's per-item outputs are themselves a corpus too large to combine in one prompt,
reduce tree-wise — fold the outputs in batches with `agent()`, then fold those partial
reduces again, until one result remains — rather than concatenating every output into a
single synthesis call that would itself overflow context.

---

## 15. Nested workflow

**Canonical:** composition — a topology as a worker inside a larger one. **Primitive:**
`workflow()`. **Guards:** re-inlining a self-contained sub-job by hand. `workflow()`
runs a saved workflow inline and returns its result. Nesting is one level deep — a
workflow called this way cannot itself call `workflow()`.

```js
phase('Gather')
const research = await workflow('research-fanout', ['question one', 'question two'])

phase('Write')
const article = await agent('Write an article from this research:\n'
  + JSON.stringify(research))
return { article }
```

---

## Defining schemas

A schema is a plain JSON Schema object. Keep them small and `required`-tight so
the subagent returns exactly what you need.

```js
const FINDINGS_SCHEMA = {
  type: 'object',
  required: ['findings'],
  properties: {
    findings: {
      type: 'array',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        required: ['title', 'file'],
        properties: {
          title: { type: 'string' },
          file:  { type: 'string' },
          line:  { type: 'number' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

const VERDICT_SCHEMA = {
  type: 'object',
  required: ['isReal'],
  properties: {
    isReal:   { type: 'boolean' },
    refuted:  { type: 'boolean' },
    reason:   { type: 'string' },
  },
}
```

Define schemas in the body (after `meta`), as `const`s — never inside `meta`.
