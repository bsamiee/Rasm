# [TYPESCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE_TREE]

The lib branch is ONE npm package `@rasm/ts` of FIVE FLAT higher-order domain folders directly under `libs/typescript/` — the top-level folders ARE the domains, never a `packages/` directory, never an `@rasm/<pkg>` nesting, never five separately-published packages, and never a `src/` nesting: each domain folder holds its `.ts` module leaves DIRECTLY at the domain root (`interchange/transport.ts`, not `interchange/src/transport.ts`), matching the C# and Python branch layouts. The publication/reachability split is a subpath-export attribute plus a folder-scoped lint stratum, never the folder axis and never a separate package: a platform-neutral interior (`interchange` + `projection`, stratum `neutral`), a browser publication of TWO folders (`ui`, the AppUi-analog UI library, stratum `browser`, subpath `./ui`; `platform`, the AppHost-analog SPA infrastructure + entry, stratum `browser`, subpath `./web`), and a node publication (`services`, stratum `node`, subpaths `./node` + `./provisioning`). This page is the planning atlas: the flat source tree projected from the twenty domain pages, the inter-domain dependency direction enforced by the folder-scoped `no-restricted-imports` strata, the descriptor-pipeline placement in the `interchange` folder, the `./provisioning` exports subpath isolating the `services/provisioning` closure, and the `GlbViewport` refinement-horizon entry. The tree is re-derived from the finalized owner set each loop. This is a `CROSS_PACKAGE_LAWS`-tier (ATLAS) page.

## [2]-[SOURCE_TREE]

The branch is ONE package: the root carries the single `package.json` (catalog refs + subpath `exports` + the folder-stratum ESLint flat-config), `tsconfig.base.json`, the shared `vitest.workspace.ts`, and the root solution `tsconfig.json` whose `references` rows register each domain folder as a project reference for incremental builds (project references are a compiler concern, not a publication boundary). Each domain is a top-level folder with its `.ts` module leaves DIRECTLY at the folder root (NO `src/`) and a `.planning/` charter+pages, but NO own `package.json`. Inter-domain dependency direction is enforced by the folder-scoped ESLint `no-restricted-imports` strata (`browser`/`node`/`neutral` globs), the `projection/**` `@connectrpc/*` ban as the intra-neutral guard, and the `ui/**`-specific `../platform` ban as the intra-browser guard.

```

Per-module specs are co-located one-per-source-module-per-category as `*.spec.ts` beside each owner leaf under the test category the page assigns; each domain's `test/` holds only its shared arbitrary registry, layer materialization, and (for `services`) the durable container harness. The folder set is the twenty domain pages projected at owner granularity across five domains; `gen`/`gen/descriptors` are codegen artifacts in `interchange` and `provisioning/` is the `./provisioning` exports-subpath leaf in `services`. Net: interchange 3 + projection 2 + ui 3 + platform 7 + services 5 = 20 charter domain pages, where `ui/component-system/` and `services/provisioning/` are owner-block sub-folders (one charter page each, multi-leaf) so the physical module-leaf count exceeds the page count: a single-axis page transcribes to one flat module (`platform/routing-navigation.ts`), a page whose owner set spans a real taxonomy or two-altitude split is an owner-block sub-folder. The `interchange/index.ts` barrel is the ONE sanctioned neutral-interior public-surface owner that intentionally re-exports `../projection` (the single admitted exception to the no-barrel law, recorded in the package charter), since `projection` has no own subpath and both folders compose under `.`.

## [3]-[PUBLICATION_TAG_SPLIT]

Five flat domain folders in one package, each independently consumable through a subpath export, in three reachability strata; the bundle split is a subpath-export attribute plus a folder-scoped lint stratum, never a folder boundary, never a separate package, and never a runtime guard.

- Platform-neutral interior: `interchange` (stratum `neutral`) and `projection` (stratum `neutral`) — both browser/node publications compose them through the one `.` export, which `interchange/index.ts` aggregates by re-exporting both neutral folders (`projection` has no own subpath). Because both are neutral, the stratum graph does not separate the `CommandGateway`-reads-`AvailabilityStore` intra-neutral seam, so the `projection/**` `no-restricted-imports` ban on `@connectrpc/*` is the sole mechanical guard keeping the fold interior transport-free; the read is an intra-package module edge.
- Browser publication (two folders): `ui` (stratum `browser`, subpath `./ui`) is the standalone-consumable UI library (the AppUi-analog) importing `interchange` + `projection`; `platform` (stratum `browser`, subpath `./web`) is the SPA application infrastructure + ENTRY (the AppHost-analog) whose root `CompositionRoot` (`platform/browser.ts`) assembles `ui` + `interchange` + `projection` into one Layer graph and one runtime. `platform` MAY import `ui` (the entry composes the UI library); `ui` MAY NEVER import `platform` — the intra-browser dependency direction the `ui/**`-specific lint rule enforces, mirroring the inward `interchange` <- `projection` direction.
- Node publication: `services` (stratum `node`) is the node entry, importing `interchange` + `projection`; the durable cluster, runner backplane, internal RPC, persistence, hybrid search, and provisioning surfaces compose under one node runtime; `./node` is the runtime entry subpath and `./provisioning` is the deploy-time subpath keeping `@pulumi/*` off the runtime hot path.

The bidirectional bundle fence is a compile-time folder-stratum lint constraint: a `browser` folder (`ui` or `platform`) imports only `browser` and `neutral` folders, a `node` folder only `node` and `neutral` folders, a `neutral` folder only `neutral` folders, and a `ui` folder additionally never imports `platform`. So `@effect/cluster`, `@effect/workflow`, `@effect/sql-pg`, the `@pulumi/*` rows, `ioredis`, and `@effect/platform-node` never enter the browser bundle, and `@effect/platform-browser`, `react`, `@effect-atom/atom-react`, `maplibre-gl`, the `@deck.gl/*` rows, `arctic`, `nuqs`, `react-error-boundary`, the `workbox-*` rows, and `vite` never enter the node bundle — the per-subpath bundle is tree-shaken from the one package by its entry. A cross-stratum source import, or a `ui` -> `platform` import, is the named coupling defect the folder-scoped lint rejects at lint time and the subpath bundler at build time.

## [4]-[DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION]

Dependencies flow inward from the publication entries toward the wire boundary; no domain depends on a domain above it in the flow, the node tier never depends on the browser folders, and inside the browser stratum `platform` depends on `ui` and never the reverse.

```mermaid

flowchart LR
    accTitle: TypeScript five-domain dependency direction
    accDescr: The descriptor pipeline feeds interchange; interchange feeds projection; interchange and projection feed both browser folders (ui and platform) and the node folder services; platform composes ui; the bundle fence is the folder-scoped no-restricted-imports stratum set, the projection connect-web ban, and the ui-no-platform intra-browser guard inside the one package.
    Desc["interchange/gen/descriptors + buf.gen.yaml"] --> Gen["interchange/gen"]
    Gen --> Inter["interchange folder (neutral)"]
    Inter --> Proj["projection folder (neutral)"]
    Inter --> Ui["ui folder (./ui entry)"]
    Proj --> Ui
    Inter --> Plat["platform folder (./web entry)"]
    Proj --> Plat
    Ui --> Plat
    Inter --> Svc["services folder (./node entry)"]
    Proj --> Svc
```

Text equivalent: the committed descriptor set drives `buf generate` into `interchange/gen`; `interchange` derives transport, clients, decode/encode rails, refinement, geometry, artifact frames, the exhaustive fault family, quarantine, and the outbound command gateway from those descriptors; `projection` folds decoded values into keyed `SubscriptionRef`-backed stores over the `StreamPolicy` reconnect vocabulary, dialing nothing (and importing no `@connectrpc/*`); `ui` subscribes to the stores through the one `AtomBinding`, renders the leaf routes and the geo surface, emits intents through the `interchange` `CommandGateway`, and holds no domain state; `platform` composes `ui` into the SPA root binding `RuntimeConfig`/`BrowserPlatform`/`AuthSession`/`SelfTelemetry`/`LocalPersistence`/`DecodeWorkerPool` plus the five strengthened infrastructure owners (`AppRouter`/`ServiceWorkerHost`/`CrashTelemetry`/`RemoteConfig`/`PerformanceBudget`); `services` composes interchange+projection plus its own durable, runner, SQL, internal-RPC, hybrid-search, and provisioning owners. The only cycle is the read-gate-then-fold pair: `interchange` `CommandGateway` reads the `projection` `AvailabilityStore` fold and writes back the command receipt — an intra-neutral read-gate, not a tier reversal, and the gateway lives in `interchange` (the transport-owning domain) so no browser transport leaks into the fold tier. The `platform` -> `ui` edge is the one intra-browser dependency: the SPA entry composes the UI library; the reverse import is the named browser-internal coupling defect.

## [5]-[DESCRIPTOR_PIPELINE_PLACEMENT]

The buf descriptor pipeline is a build-time stage in `interchange` landing its input and output as committed tree leaves directly at the domain root, so the runtime modules import generated values and never run the generator:

- Input leaf: `interchange/gen/descriptors` holds the app-root-emitted `FileDescriptorSet`, the same descriptor set the C# `ContractGuard` publishes beside the discovery manifest; the buf input row points here, never at a `.proto` tree.
- Config leaf: `interchange/buf.gen.yaml` carries the single-plugin v2 codegen config `transport.md#CODEGEN_TOOLING` fixes — one `protoc-gen-es` plugin, `target=ts`, `include_imports: true`, emitting `.ts` with the transitive descriptor graph embedded.
- Output leaf: `interchange/gen` holds the `*_pb.ts` descriptor modules directly at the domain root (no `src/`), one `GenService` descriptor per service; `transport.ts` imports them to derive clients through `createClient` and to construct the file-aware registry `FaultDetailRail` passes to `findDetails`.
- Build edge: the generation pass runs as a pnpm build step ahead of the tsgo type-check and the bundle; `@bufbuild/buf` (`allowBuilds: true` in the catalog) drives the pass and never enters a runtime import; a hand-edit of a generated module is the deleted form.

## [6]-[REFINEMENT_HORIZON]

The GLB concern splits across two altitudes: the GLB BYTE/ARTIFACT layer is landed, and only the WebGL MESH-RENDER layer is on the horizon. GLB is a server-streamed content-addressed artifact, so `interchange` `ArtifactFrameRail` (codec-rails#CODEC_RAILS) reassembles the `ArtifactFrameWire` frames into a Crc32-verified XxHash128-keyed blob today — the transcribable wire-consumption surface for GLB import and export over the existing `#TS_PROJECTION` fence. What stays deferred is `GlbViewport`, the WebGL render of a mesh, one owner-anchored refinement-horizon entry on ui/render-surfaces.md, NOT a page this turn: its mesh-render input is verified present only in C# `remote-lane.md#PROTO_VOCABULARY` and absent from the `#TS_PROJECTION` fence, so `interchange` has no transcribable mesh Schema and SIGNATURE_LAW forbids TS authoring one. The render entry routes as a four-end cross-branch precondition-DAG (the seam row lives in `region-map/seam-splits.md`): (a) C# `remote-lane.md#TS_PROJECTION` promotes `MeshTensor`/`GeometryPayload(mesh)` from `[PROTO_VOCABULARY]` into the projection fence — the single true blocker; (b) C# `interchange.md` authoring DISCHARGED; (c) the Python `libs/python/compute` IFC->GLB two-hop companion authors — a precondition the TS branch observes; (d) only then `ui` admits a WebGL viewer with a `Schema.Literal` renderer-backend axis admitting three/babylon/model-viewer and a webgpu literal for the meshlet/cluster-LOD ambition. ZERO WebGL packages are admitted until the upstream mesh `#TS_PROJECTION` exists. The viewer is a `ui` render-surface, not a `platform` infrastructure owner — the horizon entry stays on the UI library that owns the render leaves.

## [7]-[ATLAS_LAW]

- The tree is the live file plan re-derived from the finalized owner set each loop; a new owner lands as a leaf or a row on an existing leaf in its owning domain, never a new domain unless a genuinely new bounded concern warrants one.
- One owner has exactly one physical leaf; an owner split across two files or two owners fused into one undifferentiated module is the named layout defect. A page whose owner set spans a real interaction-role taxonomy or a two-altitude deploy split is an owner-block sub-folder (`ui/component-system/`, `services/provisioning/`), never a single flat module; a single-axis page transcribes to one flat module (`services/durable-execution.ts`, `platform/routing-navigation.ts`). NO domain folder carries a `src/` interior — module leaves sit directly at the domain root.
- The domain partition mirrors the page partition: five domain folders in one package, each with its `.planning/` charter and pages; `gen`/`gen/descriptors` are codegen artifacts in the `interchange` folder and `provisioning/` is the `./provisioning` subpath leaf in the `services` folder.
- The node folder carries no browser import and the browser folders carry no node import; the folder-scoped `browser`/`node`/`neutral` `no-restricted-imports` strata, the `projection/**` `@connectrpc/*` ban, and the `ui/**`-specific `../platform` ban are the enforcement points inside the one project, and a cross-stratum source import, a transport dial in the fold interior, or a `ui` -> `platform` import is the named coupling defect.
- The two browser folders share ONE browser-mode vitest project (`browser`) covering both `ui/**` and `platform/**` specs — the playwright provider is folder-agnostic and the browser publication is one runtime, so a second runner config is the named test-config defect.
- Every deepening-horizon owner lands on the densest owning domain page and surfaces here as a leaf; `GlbViewport` is the one refinement-horizon owner with no page and no leaf this turn, admitted on `ui/render-surfaces` only when the upstream mesh fence exists.
