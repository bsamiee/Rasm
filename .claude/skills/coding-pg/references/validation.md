# Validation

Compliance checklist for PostgreSQL 18 SQL code. Run after writing or modifying SQL. Each item is a pass/fail gate --- violations require correction before merge.


## Type Integrity

- [ ] Every semantic concept has ONE domain type --- no duplicate CHECK constraints across tables
- [ ] Range columns use range types (`tstzrange`, etc.) --- no dual `start`/`end` column pairs
- [ ] `NOT NULL` is default --- every nullable column has documented justification
- [ ] `uuidv7()` for new PK generation --- no `uuid-ossp` or `pgcrypto` dependency for IDs
- [ ] Virtual generated columns for read-computed projections --- stored only when indexing required
- [ ] Enum types used only for truly fixed sets --- domain-constrained text for evolving vocabularies


## Query Integrity

- [ ] Set-algebraic operations --- no row-at-a-time PL/pgSQL loops for transformations expressible as single statements
- [ ] `MERGE` for conditional writes --- no separate INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT sequences
- [ ] `MERGE RETURNING OLD.*, NEW.*, merge_action()` for write-audit fusion --- no trigger-based audit
- [ ] `LATERAL JOIN` for correlated subqueries --- no scalar subqueries in SELECT list
- [ ] `JSON_TABLE` / `jsonb_path_query` for structured JSON extraction --- no application-side JSON parsing
- [ ] Window functions with appropriate framing --- no GROUP BY + self-join for running calculations
- [ ] Keyset pagination --- no OFFSET pagination
- [ ] `FILTER (WHERE ...)` for conditional aggregation --- no `CASE WHEN ... THEN value ELSE NULL END` inside aggregate
- [ ] `NOT EXISTS` for anti-joins --- no `NOT IN` (NULL-unsafe: any NULL in subquery makes entire predicate UNKNOWN)
- [ ] `EXISTS` for semi-joins --- no `SELECT DISTINCT` on correlated/joined data (forces sort/dedup instead of early-exit)
- [ ] VALUES-based dispatch in PL/pgSQL --- no IF/THEN/ELSIF chains for operation routing
- [ ] Composable aggregates in hierarchical CAGGs (avg/count/sum/stddev) --- no PERCENTILE_CONT across tiers


## Index Integrity

- [ ] Every WHERE clause pattern on tables > 10K rows has a corresponding index
- [ ] Partial indexes for selective predicates (< 20% selectivity)
- [ ] `INCLUDE` columns on high-frequency index-only scan paths
- [ ] GIN for JSONB containment, array overlap, full-text search --- not B-tree
- [ ] GiST for range overlap, spatial queries, exclusion constraints --- not B-tree
- [ ] BRIN for append-only monotonic columns --- verify `pg_stats.correlation` > 0.9
- [ ] Bloom index for wide tables with arbitrary equality combinations (>5 columns) --- not N single-column B-trees
- [ ] No redundant indexes --- composite (a, b) subsumes single-column (a)
- [ ] All indexes created with `CONCURRENTLY` in production migrations
- [ ] `pg_stat_user_indexes.idx_scan = 0` indexes investigated and justified or removed


## DDL Integrity

- [ ] Temporal constraints use `WITHOUT OVERLAPS` (PG 18) --- no trigger-based overlap prevention
- [ ] Exclusion constraints for business-rule overlap prevention --- not application-side checks
- [ ] `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s'` before DDL taking AccessExclusiveLock
- [ ] Partition key included in PRIMARY KEY and all UNIQUE constraints
- [ ] `clock_timestamp()` for insert timestamps --- not `now()` (which returns transaction start)
- [ ] Foreign keys explicitly named --- no auto-generated constraint names
- [ ] `DETACH PARTITION ... CONCURRENTLY` for online partition removal


## Security Integrity

- [ ] RLS enabled and FORCED on every tenant-scoped table
- [ ] RLS policies use `nullif(current_setting('app.current_tenant', true), '')` for fail-closed tenant scoping --- no hardcoded literals
- [ ] `SECURITY INVOKER` explicit on all new functions --- `SECURITY DEFINER` only with `SET search_path`
- [ ] Column-level GRANT for sensitive data --- password hashes, MFA secrets, tokens never granted to readonly roles
- [ ] Application connections use non-superuser role without BYPASSRLS
- [ ] `scram-sha-256` authentication --- no md5 (deprecated PG 18)


## Performance Integrity

- [ ] `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)` verified for new query patterns
- [ ] Index Only Scan achieved where expected --- `Heap Fetches` near zero after VACUUM
- [ ] Row estimate accuracy within 10x of actual --- stale statistics triggers ANALYZE
- [ ] `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent batch processing --- no bare `FOR UPDATE` on queue tables
- [ ] Functions marked `IMMUTABLE`/`STABLE`/`VOLATILE` accurately
- [ ] Functions marked `PARALLEL SAFE` when eligible


## Integration Integrity (Effect-SQL)

PG type to Effect Schema mapping:

| PG Type       | Effect Schema               | Notes                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `int4`        | `S.Int`                     | 32-bit signed integer                    |
| `int8`        | `S.BigInt`                  | 64-bit --- JS Number overflows           |
| `numeric`     | `S.BigDecimal`              | Arbitrary precision                      |
| `text`        | `S.String`                  | Unbounded text                           |
| `boolean`     | `S.Boolean`                 | Boolean                                  |
| `uuid`        | `S.UUID`                    | UUID string with format validation       |
| `timestamptz` | `S.DateTimeUtc`             | Timezone-aware timestamp                 |
| `jsonb`       | `Model.JsonFromString(...)` | Schema-validated JSON column             |
| `bytea`       | `S.Uint8ArrayFromBase64`    | Binary data with base64 codec            |
| `tstzrange`   | `S.Unknown` + custom codec  | No native mapping; hand-roll range parse |

PG error codes to Effect tagged errors:

| PG Error Code | Name                    | Effect Error Strategy                |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `23505`       | `unique_violation`      | Map to `ConflictError`               |
| `23503`       | `foreign_key_violation` | Map to `NotFoundError` (referential) |
| `40001`       | `serialization_failure` | Retry with `Schedule.exponential`    |
| `40P01`       | `deadlock_detected`     | Retry with `Schedule.exponential`    |
| `57014`       | `query_canceled`        | Map to timeout tagged error          |

- [ ] Server-defaulted columns (`DEFAULT uuidv7()`, `DEFAULT clock_timestamp()`, `GENERATED ALWAYS AS`) use `Model.Generated` — never `Model.GeneratedByApp` (which signals client-side generation)
- [ ] `Model.Generated` implies the column has a DDL-level default and must NOT appear in INSERT payloads
- [ ] `Model.FieldOption` fields are nullable in DDL --- NOT NULL + FieldOption is a schema conflict
- [ ] `transformQueryNames: camelToSnake` and `transformResultNames: snakeToCamel` configured on PgClient
- [ ] SqlResolver batch queries have supporting indexes on grouping/lookup keys
- [ ] `set_config('app.current_tenant', ..., true)` with `local=true` for transaction-scoped RLS
- [ ] `sql.reserve` used for session-pinned operations (advisory locks, temp tables) through PgBouncer
- [ ] Migration uses `Effect.gen` + `SqlClient` --- not raw SQL strings
- [ ] Entity ID fields use `S.UUID.pipe(S.brand('EntityNameId'))` — raw `S.UUID` is forbidden for PKs and FKs. Domain types in DDL must have corresponding branded schemas in TypeScript
- [ ] Batch operations use `unnest(array[])` — not row-at-a-time PL/pgSQL loops or application-side iteration
- [ ] RAG schemas: chunks table has HNSW on embedding + GIN on tsvector; document_id FK with ON DELETE CASCADE; tenant_id with RLS


## Migration Safety

### Lock-Level Awareness

| DDL Statement                          | Lock Level               | Online-Safe?                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`            | ShareUpdateExclusiveLock | Yes                                                  |
| `CREATE INDEX` (non-concurrent)        | ShareLock                | Blocks writes                                        |
| `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` (nullable)    | AccessExclusiveLock      | Brief                                                |
| `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN DEFAULT`       | AccessExclusiveLock      | Brief (PG 11+: no rewrite for non-volatile defaults) |
| `ALTER TABLE SET NOT NULL`             | AccessExclusiveLock      | Scans table                                          |
| `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`           | AccessExclusiveLock      | Scans table                                          |
| `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT NOT VALID` | AccessExclusiveLock      | Brief                                                |
| `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`                  | ShareUpdateExclusiveLock | Yes                                                  |
| `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`              | ShareUpdateExclusiveLock | Yes                                                  |
| `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`              | AccessExclusiveLock      | Brief                                                |

### Safe Pattern: Adding NOT NULL Column

1. `ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN col type` --- nullable, AccessExclusiveLock (brief, no rewrite)
2. Backfill in batches: `UPDATE t SET col = ... WHERE col IS NULL AND id BETWEEN $1 AND $2`
3. `ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT col_nn CHECK (col IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID` --- AccessExclusiveLock (brief, no scan)
4. `ALTER TABLE t VALIDATE CONSTRAINT col_nn` --- ShareUpdateExclusiveLock (scans, allows concurrent DML)
5. Optionally: `ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN col SET NOT NULL` + `ALTER TABLE t DROP CONSTRAINT col_nn` --- if native NOT NULL needed (takes AccessExclusiveLock but skips scan when valid CHECK exists)

### Contracts

- [ ] `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2s'` before any DDL taking AccessExclusiveLock --- fail fast, not block traffic
- [ ] Backward compatibility: old application code runs correctly against new schema during rolling deploy
- [ ] Extension policy documented when operationally relevant --- availability, permissions, and upgrade posture are explicit
- [ ] No `DROP COLUMN` without prior deploy removing all application references
- [ ] `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` two-phase pattern for constraints on populated tables
- [ ] Consistent table ordering across migrations prevents deadlock between concurrent runs
- [ ] `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` cannot run inside a transaction block --- migrations must use non-transactional mode for concurrent index ops


## Detection Heuristics

| Pattern to Grep                                   | Violation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start_date.*end_date` or `_start.*_end`          | DUAL_COLUMN_RANGE --- use range type                       |
| `LIMIT.*OFFSET`                                   | OFFSET_PAGINATION --- use keyset                           |
| `FOR UPDATE` without `SKIP LOCKED`                | Missing SKIP LOCKED on queue table                         |
| `SECURITY DEFINER` without `SET`                  | SECURITY_DEFINER_LEAK                                      |
| `now()` in DEFAULT                                | Use `clock_timestamp()` for wall time                      |
| `CREATE INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY`             | Missing CONCURRENTLY in migration                          |
| `LOOP` + `UPDATE` in PL/pgSQL                     | IMPERATIVE_BATCH --- use set operation                     |
| `uuid_generate_v4()` or new ordered PK `gen_random_uuid()` | Prefer `uuidv7()` for new ordered identifiers; justify random UUIDs by workload |
| `ALTER TABLE.*ADD CONSTRAINT` without `NOT VALID` | Missing two-phase constraint addition                      |
| `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` without `FORCE`       | Table owner bypasses RLS                                   |
| `CREATE EXTENSION` without current extension policy | Verify extension availability, permissions, and upgrade posture |
| `NOT IN` with subquery                            | NULL_UNSAFE_ANTIJOIN --- use NOT EXISTS                    |
| `SELECT DISTINCT` on joined tables                | DISTINCT_OVER_EXISTS --- use EXISTS semi-join              |
| `CREATE POLICY` without `current_setting`         | STRINGLY_POLICY --- hardcoded literals in RLS              |
| `CREATE TRIGGER` in migration                     | TRIGGER_LOGIC --- use MERGE RETURNING or generated columns |
| `IF.*THEN.*ELSIF` in PL/pgSQL                     | IF_THEN_DISPATCH --- use VALUES-based dynamic SQL          |
| `EXCLUDE.*&&` on temporal in PostgreSQL 18        | EXCLUDE_OVER_WITHOUT_OVERLAPS --- use WITHOUT OVERLAPS when equality + range overlap is enough |


## Skill Eval Prompts

- Explicit invocation: "Using coding-pg, design a temporal pricing table with PostgreSQL 18 constraints and validation commands."
- Implicit invocation: "Review this migration.sql for PostgreSQL 18 RLS, MERGE, index, and temporal-table issues."
- Noisy context: "Given this app bug, ignore framework chatter and audit only the embedded SQL for doctrine violations."
- Negative control: "Write TypeScript domain models only." Expected: do not invoke PostgreSQL references unless SQL or schema design appears.
- Compliance checks: output should load only task-relevant references, avoid command thrash, avoid creating helper files, preserve `uuidv7()`/`WITHOUT OVERLAPS`/RLS doctrine, and run `../scripts/pg_lint.sh` from this references directory when SQL text or fixtures are available.
| `S.UUID` without `S.brand` for PK/FK              | RAW_UUID_ID --- brand entity IDs                           |
