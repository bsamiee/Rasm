# [H1][README-STANDARDS]
>**Dictum:** *README structure determines project adoption velocity.*

<br>

[CRITICAL] README is the single entry point for every audience. Structure encodes progressive disclosure—each audience tier inherits prior tiers.

---
## [1][ANATOMY]
>**Dictum:** *Canonical sections in canonical order.*

<br>

Standard-README specification. Section order is fixed—never reorder.

| [INDEX] | [SECTION]         | [REQUIRED]  | [CONTENT]                                                          |
| :-----: | ----------------- | :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | Title             |     Yes     | Project name. Single `#` H1. No tagline — that belongs in [3].     |
|   [2]   | Badges            | Conditional | CI status, coverage, version, license. Omit if no CI.              |
|   [3]   | Description       |     Yes     | One paragraph. What the project does, why it exists.               |
|   [4]   | Table of Contents | Conditional | Required when >4 sections visible.                                 |
|   [5]   | Security          | Conditional | Vulnerability reporting instructions. Required for public repos.   |
|   [6]   | Background        | Conditional | Domain context, motivation, prior art. Required for novel domains. |
|   [7]   | Install           |     Yes     | Exact commands. Prerequisites. Environment requirements.           |
|   [8]   | Usage             |     Yes     | Minimum viable example — runnable, not comprehensive.              |
|   [9]   | API               | Conditional | Public surface reference. Required for libraries.                  |
|  [10]   | Architecture      | Conditional | System context + component overview. Required for services.        |
|  [11]   | Contributing      | Conditional | Setup, conventions, PR workflow. Required for open-source.         |
|  [12]   | License           |     Yes     | SPDX identifier. Link to LICENSE file.                             |

## [2][AUDIENCES]
>**Dictum:** *Each audience tier adds depth; none removes sections.*

<br>

| [INDEX] | [TIER]      | [TIME_BUDGET] | [SECTIONS_REQUIRED]          | [DEPTH]                                     |
| :-----: | ----------- | :-----------: | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
|   [1]   | Evaluator   |    30 sec     | Title, Description, Badges   | Scan-quality: can this solve my problem?    |
|   [2]   | Adopter     |    10 min     | + Install, Usage, License    | Setup-quality: can I get this running?      |
|   [3]   | Contributor |    30 min     | + Architecture, Contributing | Orientation-quality: where does my code go? |

[IMPORTANT]:
1. [ALWAYS] **Canonical order:** Preserve section order from §1; project type changes section presence and depth, not ordering.
2. [ALWAYS] **Progressive disclosure:** Evaluator content precedes Adopter content precedes Contributor content.

---
## [3][SECTIONS]
>**Dictum:** *Per-section content requirements eliminate ambiguity.*

<br>

### [3.1][DESCRIPTION]

One paragraph. Three components: what it does, what problem it solves, what distinguishes it from alternatives. No feature lists—feature lists belong in Usage or API.

### [3.2][INSTALL]

Exact shell commands for each supported environment. Prerequisites table: runtime version, required system dependencies, environment variables. Verification command proves successful installation.

### [3.3][USAGE]

Minimum viable example: smallest working invocation demonstrating primary value. Runnable—not pseudocode, not truncated. For libraries: importable code block. For services: `curl` or CLI command with expected output. For CLIs: help output + primary command.

### [3.4][ARCHITECTURE]

System context diagram (C4 Level 1): project as single box with external dependencies and consumers. Component overview: 3-7 primary modules with one-line responsibility descriptions. Dependency direction: arrows show data flow, not import direction.

[IMPORTANT]:
- [ALWAYS] **Bounded-context names:** Use stable module or service names that describe ownership boundaries.
- [ALWAYS] **Diagram reference:** Include Mermaid inline or link to rendered diagram.

[CRITICAL]:
- [NEVER] Add implementation details in Architecture—Architecture shows structure, not logic.
- [NEVER] Use class diagrams—use component or container diagrams instead.

## [4][PROJECT_TYPE_ROUTING]
>**Dictum:** *Project type determines section emphasis.*

<br>

| [INDEX] | [PROJECT_TYPE] | [EMPHASIS_SECTIONS]             | [ORDER_RULE]                               |
| :-----: | -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | Library        | Install, API, Usage             | Use canonical order; include API.          |
|   [2]   | Service        | Architecture, Install, Usage    | Use canonical order; include Architecture. |
|   [3]   | CLI            | Install, Usage                  | Use canonical order; emphasize commands.   |
|   [4]   | Monorepo       | Architecture, Install, packages | Use canonical order; link package READMEs. |

## [5][VALIDATION]
>**Dictum:** *Gates prevent incomplete documentation.*

<br>

[VERIFY] Completion:
- [ ] Title is single H1 matching project/package name.
- [ ] Description is one paragraph with what/why/distinction.
- [ ] Install commands are copy-pasteable and verified.
- [ ] Usage example is runnable — not pseudocode.
- [ ] All conditional sections included per project type routing.
- [ ] Audience tiers are progressively disclosed — evaluator content first.
- [ ] No implementation details in Architecture section.
- [ ] License section contains SPDX identifier.
