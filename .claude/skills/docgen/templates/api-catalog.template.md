# [<TIER>_API_<PACKAGE>]

<catalog-charter-2-4-sentences: the one capability this external surface owns, the boundary it holds, and the rail it feeds; never a roster recap, an install note, or a realization stamp.>

<!-- source-only: `.api` CATALOG SCHEMA — an external-library capability INDEX that lets a design-page fence author call this surface with zero external lookups. It is NOT a design page: it carries abbreviated signatures, never transcription fences.

BODY MODE — pick by owner count, never taste:
  A ROSTER_FIRST (default, single-owner): `[01]-[PACKAGE_SURFACE]` `[02]-[PUBLIC_TYPES]` `[03]-[ENTRYPOINTS]` `[04]-[IMPLEMENTATION_LAW]`.
  B CONCEPT_PARTITIONED (large multi-namespace substrate re-exporting many owners): `[01]-[PACKAGE_SURFACE]`, then one `## [NN]-[<CONCEPT>]` per owned namespace (each carrying its own `[<CONCEPT>_TYPE_SCOPE]:`/`[<CONCEPT>_ENTRY_SCOPE]:` sub-blocks + tables), then the terminal `## [NN]-[IMPLEMENTATION_LAW]`. `[STACKING]` and `[RAIL_LAW]` stay in the terminal law section in both modes.

SIGNATURES — abbreviated in the table cell, NEVER a transcription fence (the full declaration lives on the design page that composes this surface; a fence here only bloats the catalog). Carry the caller's three load-bearing facts — member name, argument shape, return shape — and nothing else:
  C# / TS  `Owner.member(TypeA, TypeB)` or `Owner.make(Type) -> Refined` — namespace dropped (owned in `[01]`), parameter TYPES only, `-> Ret` only when the return is load-bearing; a TS generic collapses to its resolved shape, never its conditional/mapped type-level machinery.
  Python   `member(arg, arg, *, kw) -> Ret` — parameter NAMES kept with the `*` / `/` markers (the call contract), type hints stripped; a shared-kwarg family hoists to one `- <family> carry: kw, kw` lead line above the table.

COLUMNS are a closed set, never renamed per file:
  `[02]` types       = `[INDEX] [SYMBOL] [TYPE_FAMILY] [CAPABILITY]`   ([TYPE_FAMILY] from union / smart-enum / value-object / struct / class / interface / enum / delegate)
  `[03]` entrypoints = `[INDEX] [SURFACE] [SHAPE] [CAPABILITY]`         ([SHAPE] from static / instance / factory / ctor / property / operator / fold)
  An optional `[CONSUMER]` column rides ONLY where the binding consumer is load-bearing and varies per row. No per-row `[RAIL]` column — the rail is one `[01]` field, never a column that repeats it.

MEMBERS are table rows or one inline token line (`[<TYPE>]: `a` `b` `c``); never a run-on `- Members: a, b, c` bullet and never a `[SLUG]: - Members:` card cluster. A row that will not fit relieves its cells or splits into sibling scopes — a table is never torn into prose. Rows are unbounded; the 150-column width cap is the only size law.

CURRENCY — a catalog presents only the library's live current surface: an obsolete, deprecated, or superseded member, overload, or import path drops whole — catalog the live replacement, never the dead form beside a pointer — and every `use Y instead` / `replaced by` / `formerly` / `in older versions` phrasing removes silently, no tombstone. A domain symbol genuinely named `Version`/`Legacy`/`Obsolete` that IS the live surface is real surface, kept. -->

## [01]-[PACKAGE_SURFACE]

[PACKAGE_SURFACE]: `<package-id>`
- package: `<package-id>` (`<license>`, `<copyright-or-org>`)
- <asset-field>: <what ships and the ABI it binds>
- rail: <one-line role this package plays in the branch>

<!-- source-only: field labels are lowercase and closed. Required: `package`, `rail`, and the language asset field —
  C#      `- assembly:` `<dll>`   `- namespace:` `<ns>, <ns>`
  Python  `- module:` `<import-name>`   `- namespaces:` `<ns>, <ns>`
  TS      `- module:` <esm/cjs shape, subpath exports>   `- runtime:` <node/browser/isomorphic; peer floor>
Optional-by-condition, omitted when it decides nothing: `target`, `abi`, `plane`, `role`, `depends`. NO `version` field in any form — the manifest owns versions. A multi-package catalog stacks one `[PACKAGE_SURFACE]:` record per package, never a merged list. -->

## [02]-[PUBLIC_TYPES]

[PUBLIC_TYPE_SCOPE]: <what this cluster of types is>

| [INDEX] | [SYMBOL]   | [TYPE_FAMILY]      | [CAPABILITY]                |
| :-----: | :--------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------- |
|  [01]   | `<Symbol>` | <family-1-2-words> | <capability-phrase>         |
|  [02]   | `Shape`    | union              | the closed shape vocabulary |
|  [03]   | `Variant`  | smart-enum         | the bounded case set        |

## [03]-[ENTRYPOINTS]

[ENTRYPOINT_SCOPE]: <what these surfaces do>

| [INDEX] | [SURFACE]                   | [SHAPE]  | [CAPABILITY]                       |
| :-----: | :-------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------- |
|  [01]   | `Shape.refine(Variant)`     | instance | refine one shape to canonical form |
|  [02]   | `Shape.of(Type) -> Refined` | factory  | admit a raw value to the surface   |

<!-- source-only: one member per row, signature abbreviated per the schema rule above. A load-bearing behavioral caveat a signature cannot show — a discarded return, an in-place mutation, a null-despite-signature — rides one `- \`Owner.member\`: <caveat>` line after the table, never a wider cell and never a torn card. -->

## [04]-[IMPLEMENTATION_LAW]

[TOPOLOGY]:
- <the invariant law every op on this surface folds through>

[STACKING]:
- `<sibling-package>`(`.api/<path>`): <exact member-level seam — what this surface's outputs become on the sibling's rail>
- <within-lib-owner>: <how the owning folder or kernel composes this surface to its richest depth>

[LOCAL_ADMISSION]:
- <accept-in-repo rule>

[RAIL_LAW]:
- Package: `<package-id>`
- Owns: <the capability this catalog is the sole owner of>
- Accept: <the composed shapes this package's role admits>
- Reject: <the hand-rolled or naive form a denser owner forecloses>

<!-- source-only: `[04]` sub-labels are the closed, ordered set `[TOPOLOGY]` `[STACKING]` `[LOCAL_ADMISSION]` `[RAIL_LAW]` — never renamed per file (no `[<PKG>_TOPOLOGY]`, no `[STACKS_WITH]`/`[STACK_LAW]` for `[STACKING]`), never hoisted to their own `## [NN]` sections. `[STACKING]` carries BOTH axes to operator depth: one bullet per composing sibling `.api` naming the exact member-level seam — this surface's output flowing into the sibling's named member, both ends verified by reading the substrate tier and the named sibling catalog before authoring — and one bullet for the within-library composition; `- (none)` only when the package genuinely stands alone, never an omitted block, and a bare package-name row with no member on both ends is the shallow-stacking defect. `[RAIL_LAW]` is structural — `Owns`/`Accept`/`Reject` are re-derived from THIS package's real surface, `Reject` naming the hand-rolled form composing it deletes; a `[RAIL_LAW]` that pastes between two unrelated packages is the byte-copy defect. -->
