    description:
        "Focused full HARDENING of the docs/stacks/csharp code doctrine — every core page AND every domain/ shard, improved in place to the same 13/10, ultra-dense, page-craft-conformant bar the python doctrine holds. The csharp set is the historical FLOOR/reference; this pass pulls it UP to that rigor: page-craft grammar (narrow index table -> deep family cards -> one agnostic snippet per region, zero duplicated demonstrations), the soft LOC density signal, extreme ADT collapse ([Union]/[SmartEnum<TKey>]/[ValueObject<T>]/[ComplexValueObject] + source-generated case families), two-weave AOP (definition-time source-gen aspects + composition-time effect transformers), LanguageExt Fin/Validation/Option/Eff rails, full parameterization/polymorphism, C# 14 on net10 to the metal. Carries the bounded interface/graph/mapping LAW extension (cross-stratum seam, graph-as-closed-family, generated mapping/equality aspects, QuikGraph/Riok.Mapperly/Generator.Equals as admitted core substrate) hardened into existing owners, plus a default-off gated new-core-page valve; restructure-free at heart — a hostile per-file harden. Inventory rules the ordered file set and the Gate rules the page roster BEFORE per-file work — true data dependence, kept. Then each FILE runs its own initial -> critique -> redteam pipeline, ALL files concurrent under one pool cap — the chain is the file's own stage dependence, never a corpus barrier. Critique and redteam read the LIVE corpus — the current on-disk state of every page, landed sibling hardening composed as found, a conflict resolved to the stronger form, never a revert — and edit ONLY their own file (the anti-collision rule among concurrent pipelines), reporting cross-file residuals. ONE terminal fable corpus agent then aligns cross-file seams, closes gaps, enforces the computation-law bodies, resolves every reported residual, and finalizes cold in one sweep. Every per-file stage and the corpus sweep carry a required-but-usually-empty harvest attestation RESTRICTED to reviewer/laws/constitution altitudes (the run authors docs/stacks/csharp, so a stacks lesson is already owned and never nominated); when the pooled nominations are non-empty, ONE terminal fable doctrine lander adjudicates them against docs/laws (refutation-first, land-nothing legal, never re-editing a docs/stacks/csharp page). Snippets agnostic (neutral names, no project anchor); every host/NuGet member verified via assay api with the .api-catalog/nuget-MCP/Context7/exa fallback; every edit scoped to docs/stacks/csharp (NEVER edit a python/typescript file).
