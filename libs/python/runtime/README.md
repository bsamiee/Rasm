# [PY_RUNTIME]

`runtime` is stratum zero of the Python branch: the host-free execution foundation every sibling composes, where proof outranks feature reach. Every shared vocabulary — content identity, fault and resilience rails, admission, lanes, logical time, receipts and telemetry, resource transport, the companion server — mints once, symbol-consumed; the module set stands alone, zero siblings installed. A defect here multiplies — every fold returns through the fault rail, every retry rides the one policy table, the C# host drives the served wire — so nothing lands as convention that can land as proof.

One polymorphic owner per sub-domain mints the shared value shapes once, and every sibling returns through them rather than re-minting its own. Companion decode admits only C#-minted wire shapes and owns no wire vocabulary, so identity crosses the runtime boundary through a single mint.
