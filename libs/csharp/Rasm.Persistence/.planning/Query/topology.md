# [PERSISTENCE_QUERY_TOPOLOGY]

Rasm.Persistence answers authoritative topology synchronously from a kind-filtered `QuikGraph` view built once per read snapshot off the `Element/graph#GRAPH_PROJECTION` `ElementGraph` — this is the DEFAULT topology owner, never an external graph database. The seam snapshot already freezes the one `FrozenDictionary<NodeId, ImmutableArray<Relationship>>` incidence index (read O(degree) through `graph.EdgesAt`) and a kind-AGNOSTIC `BidirectionalGraph<NodeId, SEdge<NodeId>>` view (`graph.Topology()`) that `Bake` needs anyway; this lane composes the ONE thing the seam view cannot express — a kind-FILTERED `BidirectionalGraph<NodeId, TypedEdge>` whose `TypedEdge` carries the neutral `Relationship` so a containment-only ancestry, a connection-only adjacency, and a void-only host-feature walk each traverse a different subgraph of the same edge set. Every algorithm is a `QuikGraph` composition off the `AlgorithmExtensions` facade — `TreeBreadthFirstSearch` reachability, `OfflineLeastCommonAncestor` nearest-common-container, `ShortestPathsDijkstra` unit-weight paths (the geometry-weighted A* route is the `Query/cypher` `pgrouting` lane's, which holds the `H3Cell` node space the seam topology lane does not), `StronglyConnectedComponents`/`WeaklyConnectedComponents` cycle and island analysis, `SourceFirstTopologicalSort` Kahn ordering, `Roots`/`Sinks` spatial-structure anchors — so the topology lane never hand-rolls a graph walk and never re-freezes a second incidence structure beside the one the seam owns. Apache AGE (`Query/cypher`) is an OPTIONAL self-hosted-only analytical projection demoted beneath this; the in-process view is the one a `Bake` needs anyway, so building the incidence index twice is the deleted form. `EdgeFilter` is the neutral edge-kind selection vocabulary every traversal routes through; `TopologyQuery` is the request `[Union]` discriminant; `TopologyView` is the content-keyed memoized view family; `TopologyResult` is the typed receipt; `TopologyFault` is the closed band a query rooted at an absent node or ordered over a cyclic graph rails. `NodeId`, `Relationship`, `RelationshipKind`, `ComposeKind`, `ElementGraph` arrive from `Rasm.Element`; the inline projection arrives from `Element/graph`; `ContentAddress.OfGraph` arrives from `Projection/address`; `ElementSet`/`SetExpr`/`StalenessWatermark` arrive from `Query/lane`; `ClockPolicy`, `CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance` arrive from the substrate.

## [01]-[INDEX]

- [01]-[GRAPH_TOPOLOGY]: the neutral `EdgeFilter` kind vocabulary, the `TypedEdge` relationship-carrying QuikGraph edge, the kind-filtered view built off the seam-frozen edge set and incidence index, and the content-keyed memoized snapshot view boundary.
- [02]-[TRAVERSAL]: the `TopologyQuery` request family, the `TopologyResult` typed receipt, the `TopologyFault` band, and the `Traversals` static surface composing the `AlgorithmExtensions` facade — containment ancestry/descent, connection adjacency, void resolution, nearest-common-container, shortest path, components, islands, topological order, anchors, and cycle detection — every result an `ElementSet`.

## [02]-[GRAPH_TOPOLOGY]

- Owner: `EdgeFilter` the `[SmartEnum<string>]` neutral edge-kind selection vocabulary carrying a `Func<Relationship, bool>` admit predicate (`All`/`Containment`/`Spatial`/`Connection`/`Void`/`Assignment`) — a traversal filters the view through a filter ROW, never a re-derived inline `is Relationship.Compose` predicate the neutral seam algebra does not own; `TypedEdge` the `IEdge<NodeId>` QuikGraph edge carrying the seam `Relationship` and its `Endpoints`-projected source/target so a kind-filtered traversal reads `edge.Kind`/`edge.IsContainment` off the neutral edge; `TopologyView` the content-keyed memoized view family; `GraphTopology` the static surface owning the kind-filtered `BidirectionalGraph<NodeId, TypedEdge>` build off the seam edge set and the content-keyed memo.
- Cases: `EdgeFilter` rows are `All` (every edge — the full reachability/cycle/island graph), `Containment` (`Compose { SubKind: Contain }` only — the narrow `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` element→placement edge a pure storey-membership query reads), `Spatial` (`Compose { SubKind: Contain | Aggregate }` — the FULL IFC spatial-structure tree the ancestry/descent/LCA/anchors walks climb, the `IfcRelAggregates` site→building→storey decomposition the storey→element containment hangs off), `Connection` (`Connect` only — MEP/path adjacency), `Void` (`Void` only — host→feature opening resolution), `Assignment` (`Assign` only — group/system/type membership); a `TypedEdge` carries its `Relationship` so a traversal filters by neutral edge kind without a parallel `RelationshipKind` enum the seam does not duplicate.
- Entry: `public static BidirectionalGraph<NodeId, TypedEdge> View(ElementGraph graph, EdgeFilter filter)` builds the kind-filtered QuikGraph view off `graph.Edges` (the seam's frozen edge set) admitting only edges the filter accepts; `public static BidirectionalGraph<NodeId, TypedEdge> Reversed(ElementGraph graph, EdgeFilter filter)` builds the same view with each edge's endpoints swapped so a forward search walks UP the relation (containment ancestry); `TopologyView.Of(ElementGraph)` mints the per-snapshot memo carrier stamping the `ContentAddress.OfGraph(graph)` as its identity, `view.Filtered(filter)`/`view.Ascending(filter)` reads the per-`(filter, ascending)` forward/reversed view from the view's own cache so a re-query of one snapshot under the same filter reuses the built view, and a `GraphDelta` (a fresh snapshot minting a fresh `TopologyView` with a fresh address and a fresh empty cache) builds it anew.
- Auto: the view is built ONCE per read snapshot off the seam edge set — the live authoring/delta path uses the seam's `ImmutableDictionary`/HAMT structural-sharing form (`Graph/delta`, O(log n) edits) and the seam freezes the incidence index plus the kind-agnostic `SEdge` view at the read-snapshot boundary (`Graph/element#ELEMENT_GRAPH` `Of`/`Topology`), so this lane NEVER re-derives the incidence index — a degree read goes through `graph.EdgesAt(node)` and only the kind-FILTERED `TypedEdge` view (the one structure the seam's `SEdge` view cannot express) is built here, the `TopologyView` minted per read snapshot carrying its `Projection/address#CONTENT_ADDRESS` `ContentAddress.OfGraph` graph content hash as identity so a `GraphDelta` (a fresh address) means a fresh view with a fresh per-instance `(filter, ascending)` cache; `View` admits an edge through `filter.Admit(edge.Edge)` and `AddVerticesAndEdge` (which adds both endpoints if absent) plus an `AddVertexRange` over `graph.Nodes.Keys` so an isolated node still participates in ordering; `Reversed` constructs each admitted `TypedEdge` with `(Target, Source)` swapped so a forward `TreeBreadthFirstSearch` ascends the spatial-structure tree without a non-existent graph-reverse member.
- Receipt: a view build rides `store.topology.build` carrying the filter key and the node/edge count; a memo hit rides `store.topology.memo` carrying the content address.
- Packages: QuikGraph (`BidirectionalGraph`/`IEdge<TVertex>`/`AddVerticesAndEdge`/`AddVertexRange`), Rasm.Element (`ElementGraph`/`Relationship`/`Relationship.Compose`/`RelationshipKind`/`ComposeKind`/`NodeId`/`EdgesAt`/`ContentAddress.OfGraph`), CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance, System.Collections.Frozen, System.Collections.Immutable, BCL inbox.
- Growth: a new edge filter is one `EdgeFilter` row carrying its `Relationship`-kind predicate; a new view orientation is the existing forward/reversed pair; zero new surface — an external graph database for authoritative topology, a per-read whole-edge scan, or a SECOND incidence structure beside the one the seam snapshot freezes is the deleted form because the seam owns the incidence index (`EdgesAt`) and the kind-agnostic view (`Topology()`), and this lane owns only the kind-filtered `TypedEdge` view.
- Boundary: the in-process QuikGraph view is the DEFAULT topology owner (`H5`) — Apache AGE is demoted to an OPTIONAL self-hosted-only analytical read projection (`Query/cypher`), so authoritative containment/connection/void topology reads bind THIS view and never assume one PostgreSQL instance hosts both AGE and Marten; the seam owns the incidence index and the kind-agnostic view and FREEZES them once (`H3`/`H4`), so this lane reads degree through `graph.EdgesAt` and builds only the kind-FILTERED `TypedEdge` view — re-deriving the incidence index here is the deleted duplication the seam's frozen index makes unnecessary, and building it twice is the named defect; the live HAMT delta path and the frozen read snapshot are distinct phases (`H4`) and the kind-filtered view memoizes on the `ContentAddress.OfGraph` content address so an unchanged graph reuses the view and a `GraphDelta` invalidates it; the `TypedEdge.IsContainment` delegates to the seam `Relationship.IsContainment` (`Compose { SubKind: Contain }`, NOT every `Compose` flavor) so the NARROW `Containment` filter never mis-admits an `Aggregate`/`Nest`/`Reference` edge — but the spatial ANCESTRY/descent/LCA/anchors walks route through the wider `Spatial` filter (`Contain` UNION `Aggregate`), the full IFC spatial-structure tree, because a Contain-only ancestry would reach an element's storey and stop short of the building/site/project the `IfcRelAggregates` decomposition models (two walls in different buildings would then share no container, the silently-incomplete spatial tree the deleted form); the topology lane is the synchronous authoritative correctness lane (`Query/lane#READ_ROUTING`) so a containment/void-resolution query reads the inline-projection-derived view, never the daemon-lagged columnar/cypher lane.

## [03]-[TRAVERSAL]

- Owner: `TopologyQuery` the `[Union]` traversal-request family; `TopologyResult` the typed result `[Union]`; `TopologyFault` the closed `Expected`-band the absent-root and cyclic-order rejections rail; `Traversals` the static surface composing the `AlgorithmExtensions` facade — containment ancestry/descent, direct placement, group/system membership, connection adjacency, void resolution, nearest-common-container, shortest path, strongly/weakly connected components, topological order, spatial-structure anchors, and cycle detection.
- Cases: on `TopologyQuery` — `Ancestry(Node, Depth)` (spatial-tree upward walk over `Contain`+`Aggregate`), `Descent(Node, Depth)` (spatial-tree downward walk), `Connected(Node)` (connection-edge SYMMETRIC adjacency — both edge directions), `Resolve(Host)` (void-edge host→feature openings — the `Query/lane#READ_ROUTING` void-resolution correctness query), `Placement(Element)` (the NARROW `Containment` filter — the single directly-containing spatial structure an element is placed in, the `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` storey distinct from the full `Spatial` ancestry climb), `Members(Group)` (the `Assignment` filter — every member of a group/system/zone, the `IfcRelAssignsToGroup` reverse read), `Ancestor(Left, Right)` (nearest common spatial container — the `IfcRelAggregates`+`IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` tree LCA), `Path(From, To)` (shortest containment/connection path), `Components` (strongly-connected partitions for cycle isolation), `Islands` (weakly-connected components — disconnected model partitions), `Anchors` (spatial-structure roots and dangling sinks), `Order` (topological dependency ordering), `Cycles` (containment-cycle detection); on `TopologyResult` — `Reached(ElementSet)`, `Route(Seq<NodeId>, double)`, `Common(Option<NodeId>)`, `Partitions(Seq<ElementSet>)`, `Ordered(Seq<NodeId>)`, `Cyclic(Seq<ElementSet>)`.
- Entry: `public static Fin<TopologyResult> Run(TopologyView view, TopologyQuery query)` dispatches the query to its QuikGraph algorithm through the generated total `Switch` (no runtime-silent arm), railing `TopologyFault.RootAbsent` when a rooted query names a node the snapshot never declares and `TopologyFault.Cyclic` when `Order` is asked over a cyclic graph; every reachability/partition traversal returns an `ElementSet`-compatible key set so a topology result composes with the `Query/lane#ELEMENT_SET_ALGEBRA` selection currency.
- Auto: spatial ancestry runs `TreeBreadthFirstSearch` over the ASCENDING `Spatial` view (the full `Contain`+`Aggregate` spatial-structure tree) bounded by depth and descent over the FORWARD `Spatial` view, the bounded reach folded off the seam-frozen incidence degree; connection adjacency unions `view.OutEdges` AND `view.InEdges` over the connection view because an `IfcRelConnectsElements` join is undirected — an out-only read would drop every peer that authored the edge from the other side; direct placement reads the element's out-edge over the ASCENDING narrow `Containment` view so the single directly-containing storey resolves without climbing the full ancestry, and group membership reads the group's out-edge over the ASCENDING `Assignment` view so the `Assign{Group}` reverse read yields every member; void resolution reads the host's void-filtered out-edges so a `Void`/`Fill` opening resolves synchronously at the authoritative lane; nearest-common-container runs `OfflineLeastCommonAncestor` over the `Spatial` tree keyed on one `SEquatableEdge<NodeId>` query pair so two elements in different buildings resolve to their shared site/project rather than stranding at a storey; shortest path runs `ShortestPathsDijkstra` over unit edge weights — the topology lane has no node coordinate (the seam holds geometry by content-hash reference, not inline), so the geometry-weighted A* route lives in the `Query/cypher` `pgrouting` lane over the `H3Cell` node space, not here; components, the cycle arm, and the topological-cycle fallback all route ONE `StronglyConnectedComponents` composition (any component of size > 1 is a cycle) rather than inlining it three times; islands run `WeaklyConnectedComponents`; anchors read `Roots`/`Sinks`; topological order runs `SourceFirstTopologicalSort` (Kahn) gated by `IsDirectedAcyclicGraph` so a residual cycle rails `TopologyFault.Cyclic` before the order is trusted; every result projects to an `ElementSet` so "every element under room X" is a `Descent` whose key set composes with any other selection.
- Receipt: a traversal rides `store.topology.<query>` carrying the reached count and the depth; a cycle detection rides `store.topology.cycle` carrying the cycle count; an absent-root rejection rides the `TopologyFault.RootAbsent` rail.
- Packages: QuikGraph (`AlgorithmExtensions.TreeBreadthFirstSearch`/`OfflineLeastCommonAncestor`/`ShortestPathsDijkstra`/`StronglyConnectedComponents`/`WeaklyConnectedComponents`/`SourceFirstTopologicalSort`/`IsDirectedAcyclicGraph`/`Roots`/`Sinks`, `BidirectionalGraph.OutEdges`/`InEdges`, `SEquatableEdge`/`TryFunc`), Rasm.Element, LanguageExt.Core, Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions, BCL inbox.
- Growth: a new traversal is one `TopologyQuery` case plus one `AlgorithmExtensions` composition reading the matching `EdgeFilter` view; zero new surface — a hand-rolled BFS/DFS, a recursive ltree CTE for in-memory ancestry, a second path solver, or a silent empty-result fallback is the deleted form because QuikGraph owns the graph algorithms, every result is an `ElementSet`, and an absent root rails the typed band.
- Boundary: every traversal is a QuikGraph `AlgorithmExtensions` composition, never a hand-rolled walk — a recursive descent over the edge sequence is the deleted form because the seam-frozen incidence index plus the kind-filtered view answer O(degree); the dispatch is the generated `query.Switch(...)` so the union is exhaustive at compile time with NO runtime-silent `_` arm, and an absent root is a typed `TopologyFault.RootAbsent` on the `Fin` rail rather than a silent `ElementSet.Empty` (the deleted form that fakes a successful empty query) — the one-endpoint queries gate through `Rooted` and the two-endpoint pair queries (`Ancestor`/`Path`) through `Paired` so EITHER absent endpoint rails `RootAbsent`, never a silent empty `Route`/`Common(None)` that masks an unknown vertex behind a no-path/no-ancestor result; the result is always an `ElementSet`-compatible key set so a topology query composes with the selection algebra (a `Descent` intersected with a `Classification` selection is one `SetExpr.Intersect`); cycle detection routes the ONE `StronglyConnectedComponents` composition the `Components`, `Cycles`, and `Order`-fallback arms share rather than inlining the probe three times, so a containment-cycle (the `Version/merge#STRUCTURAL_DIFF` `ContainmentCycle` conflict) is caught synchronously at the authoritative lane; void resolution and nearest-common-container are first-class query cases so the `Query/lane#READ_ROUTING` void-resolution correctness query has its in-process owner rather than a prose-only claim; connection adjacency is SYMMETRIC (`OutEdges` ∪ `InEdges`) because the neutral `Connect` edge is an undirected join, an out-only read being the directionally-incomplete deleted form; `Placement` and `Members` make the narrow `Containment` and the `Assignment` filter rows load-bearing — the single directly-containing storey (distinct from the full `Spatial` ancestry) and the group/system reverse membership read are first-class queries, never prose-justified dead vocabulary rows; the shortest path is `ShortestPathsDijkstra` over unit edge weights because the seam node carries no inline coordinate (geometry is content-hash-by-reference resolved through an app-wired `GeometrySource` this lane does not compose), so the geometry-weighted A* routing query is the `pgrouting` analytical lane's (`Query/cypher`) over the `H3Cell` node space — the two meet at the result `ElementSet`, the in-process lane owning topological distance and the analytical lane the metric route, never one duplicating the other's algorithm.
