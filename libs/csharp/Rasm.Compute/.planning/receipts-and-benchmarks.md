# [COMPUTE_RECEIPTS_AND_BENCHMARKS]

One thirteen-case `ComputeReceipt` union is the package's only fact vocabulary for measured execution: every operational view derives as a fold over that stream, NodaTime-protobuf bridges own the instant, duration, and calendar wire edge, and fingerprint-gated benchmark claims decide every performance-motivated route in the suite. The page owns the receipt union with its Strict-resolver round-trip emission surface, the fold-projection family, the wire-stamp bridges, the claim table with its host fingerprint, and `ComputeWireContext` — composing `ReceiptSinkPort`, `ReceiptEnvelope`, `ClockPolicy`, `ScheduleEntry`, `TelemetryContributorPort`, and the Persistence benchmark and artifact index contracts as settled vocabulary.

## [2]-[RECEIPT_UNION]

- Owner: `ComputeReceipt`, `ComputeWireContext`, `ReceiptSurface` — the fact union, the package's one `JsonSerializerContext` partial joining the suite Strict resolver merge, and the emission-plus-telemetry surface.
- Cases: selection · tensor-run · model-load · warmup · model-run · remote-call · stream-segment · allocation · cache · unit-projection · backpressure · drain · conflict
- Entry: `public IO<ReceiptEnvelope> Emit(ReceiptSinkPort sink, JsonSerializerOptions wire)` — `IO` carries the sink effect; the returned envelope is the emission evidence.
- Auto: the wire kind derives from the polymorphic metadata pinned on the union, the HLC stamp and `SkewBound` derive inside `Send`, and the instrument rows register once at composition through `TelemetryContributorPort` — `TelemetrySource.Compute` mints the activity spine so receipt correlation joins the OTel rail with zero call-site ceremony; `ComputeWireContext` joins the suite Strict resolver merge so the polymorphic `kind` discriminator round-trips through one shared `JsonSerializerOptions`, every Thinktecture spine field crosses as its key scalar through the merged Thinktecture resolver, and the union deserializes back to the exact case with `Seq<string>` collections intact — `UnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` rejects any drifted field at the consuming edge rather than dropping it.
- Receipt: union cases materialize at the sink edge only; hot-path capsules upstream stay allocation-free and the envelope is the sole cross-process causal carrier.
- Packages: Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions, Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.Json, LanguageExt.Core, NodaTime, Rasm.AppHost (project), BCL inbox
- Growth: a new measured concern is one case row on `ComputeReceipt` plus one `[JsonDerivedType]` row and one TS payload row, zero new surface.
- Boundary: receipts are process-local and HLC-correlated, never globally shared — the envelope stamp is the only cross-process causal primitive; a generic IReceipt/ledger abstraction, a second correlation or HLC stamp, and emission bypassing the sink port are the rejected forms; the `Conflict` case is the receipt complement of the wire fault projection, carrying retry-owner and contract-checksum evidence; spine fields serialize as Thinktecture key scalars and the format members make every receipt span-writable without runtime format strings.

## [3]-[FOLD_PROJECTIONS]

- Owner: `ReceiptFolds` — every operational view is a pure fold over `Seq<ComputeReceipt>`; the fact stream is the single source and no projection accumulates mutably.
- Entry: `public HashMap<CorrelationId, Seq<ComputeReceipt>> Provenance` — the model-result provenance projection joining every receipt chain by correlation.
- Auto: per-lane counts, route histograms, hot-path totals, leak indicators, conflict evidence, and provenance chains derive on read from the identical stream the dashboards consume.
- Packages: LanguageExt.Core, NodaTime, BCL inbox
- Growth: a new operational view is one fold member row over the same fact stream, zero new surface.
- Boundary: leak indicators read the double-dispose and finalized allocation events as diagnostics, never log noise; `DiscardTaxonomy` folds the stream-pool `BufferDiscardedEventArgs.Reason` carried on the discard `Allocation.Reason` field into a reason-keyed count so an `EnoughFree`-dominant tally reads as caps-below-workload and an oversize-dominant tally as payloads-exceeding-`MaximumBufferSize` — opposite tuning moves separated by the fold, never a merged counter; `Conflicts` surfaces retry-owner and contract-checksum evidence toward the operator; a mutable accumulator, a per-view repository, and a second fact stream are the deleted forms.

```csharp signature
public static class ReceiptFolds {
    extension(Seq<ComputeReceipt> facts) {
        public HashMap<WorkLane, int> LaneCounts =>
            facts.Fold(HashMap<WorkLane, int>(), static (acc, fact) => acc.AddOrUpdate(fact.Lane, static n => n + 1, 1));

        public HashMap<Substrate, int> RouteHistogram =>
            facts.Fold(HashMap<Substrate, int>(), static (acc, fact) => acc.AddOrUpdate(fact.Substrate, static n => n + 1, 1));

        public HashMap<Substrate, Duration> HotPathTotals =>
            facts.Fold(HashMap<Substrate, Duration>(), static (acc, fact) => acc.AddOrUpdate(fact.Substrate, total => total + fact.Elapsed, fact.Elapsed));

        public Seq<ComputeReceipt.Allocation> Leaks =>
            facts.Bind(static fact => fact is ComputeReceipt.Allocation { Event: "double-dispose" or "finalized" } leak
                ? Seq(leak)
                : Seq<ComputeReceipt.Allocation>());

        public HashMap<string, int> DiscardTaxonomy =>
            facts.Fold(HashMap<string, int>(), static (acc, fact) =>
                fact is ComputeReceipt.Allocation { Event: "discard", Reason: { } reason }
                    ? acc.AddOrUpdate(reason, static n => n + 1, 1)
                    : acc);

        public Seq<ComputeReceipt.Conflict> Conflicts =>
            facts.Bind(static fact => fact is ComputeReceipt.Conflict conflict ? Seq(conflict) : Seq<ComputeReceipt.Conflict>());

        public HashMap<CorrelationId, Seq<ComputeReceipt>> Provenance =>
            facts.Fold(HashMap<CorrelationId, Seq<ComputeReceipt>>(), static (acc, fact) => acc.AddOrUpdate(fact.Correlation, chain => chain.Add(fact), Seq(fact)));
    }
}
```

## [4]-[WIRE_STAMPS]

- Owner: `WireStamps` — the NodaTime-protobuf bridge family is the only temporal crossing between the receipt rail and the proto wire, spanning the well-known `Timestamp`/`Duration` edge and the `Google.Type` calendar-date and time-of-day edge.
- Entry: `public Timestamp WirePhysical` — the envelope's HLC physical stamp projected onto the well-known wire type.
- Packages: NodaTime.Serialization.Protobuf, Google.Protobuf, NodaTime, Rasm.AppHost (project)
- Growth: a new temporal wire field is one extension row over the bridge family, zero new surface.
- Boundary: BCL `DateTime` never appears between wire and rail; pre-epoch instants and out-of-window durations are boundary faults the call edge projects onto the typed rail, and an invalid time-of-day or out-of-range day-of-week is the same boundary fault on the calendar edge; the desktop and the web dashboard consume the identical receipt stream — envelope JSON and the proto contracts are two encodings of one stream — and `SkewBound` surfaces in the evidence view with zero configuration; a sweep occurrence's calendar date, time-of-day, and day-of-week cross as `Google.Type.Date`/`TimeOfDay`/`DayOfWeek` so a dashboard groups runs by calendar day and weekday without re-deriving the instant, and `ToBase64` projects a frame or artifact checksum onto a text-safe field for the evidence view without a second hashing pass.

```csharp signature
public static class WireStamps {
    extension(ReceiptEnvelope envelope) {
        public Timestamp WirePhysical => envelope.Physical.ToTimestamp();

        public Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes.Duration WireSkew => envelope.SkewBound.ToProtobufDuration();
    }

    extension(LocalDate date) {
        public Google.Type.Date WireDate => date.ToDate();
    }

    extension(LocalTime time) {
        public Google.Type.TimeOfDay WireTimeOfDay => time.ToTimeOfDay();
    }

    extension(IsoDayOfWeek day) {
        public Google.Type.DayOfWeek WireDayOfWeek => day.ToProtobufDayOfWeek();
    }

    extension(ByteString checksum) {
        public string Base64 => checksum.ToBase64();
    }

    extension(Timestamp wire) {
        public Instant Rail => wire.ToInstant();
    }

    extension(Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes.Duration wire) {
        public Duration Rail => wire.ToNodaDuration();
    }

    extension(Google.Type.Date wire) {
        public LocalDate RailDate => wire.ToLocalDate();
    }

    extension(Google.Type.TimeOfDay wire) {
        public LocalTime RailTime => wire.ToLocalTime();
    }

    extension(Google.Type.DayOfWeek wire) {
        public IsoDayOfWeek RailDayOfWeek => wire.ToIsoDayOfWeek();
    }
}
```

## [5]-[BENCHMARK_CLAIMS]

- Owner: `BenchmarkClaim`, `HostFingerprint` — the input-class claim row and the host identity that gates it; a claim is a row, never prose.
- Cases: micro · small · medium · large payload-size bands, declared as the `Bands` rows.
- Entry: `public Option<BenchmarkRow> Claim(Seq<BenchmarkRow> rows)` — `Option` carries fingerprint admission; `None` is the fall-through to the static cost rank on the substrate row.
- Auto: `BandOf` classifies payload bytes onto the band rows; `Persist` projects the claim onto the persisted benchmark row; `Stale` derives from stamp drift so any admitted-package bump marks dependent claims stale as operator-visible evidence; `Sweep` registers the compute-equivalence-sweep cadence row whose runs execute on the `WorkLane.Benchmark` row.
- Receipt: every sweep run emits `TensorRun`/`ModelRun` receipts beside the persisted row; artifacts — chrome-trace profiles, BenchmarkDotNet exports, EP-context caches — land as `ArtifactIndexRow` paths on the blob lane and ride the `Artifacts` rows on the claim.
- Packages: BenchmarkDotNet, NodaTime, LanguageExt.Core, Rasm.AppHost (project), Rasm.Persistence (project), BCL inbox
- Growth: a new performance surface is one claim row; a new claim dimension is one column on `BenchmarkClaim`; zero new surface.
- Boundary: the claim-gate law — a SIMD default route, compression enable, ParallelHelper partitioning, or a DATAS knob binds only behind a winning claim row whose fingerprint matches the running host; tolerance classes arrive settled from the operation-family rows and loosening one to pass equivalence is the named production-slack defect; `Claim` resolves the most-recent fingerprint-matching `BenchmarkRow` against the recency horizon read by reference from the Persistence `ModelResultKey` index owner — the single horizon owner — so a stale benchmark never wins and Compute never mints a second `Duration horizon` beside the claim; a second benchmark store, BenchmarkDotNet profiler add-ons, and prose performance claims are the rejected forms.

```csharp signature
public sealed record HostFingerprint(string Os, string Arch, int Processors, FrozenDictionary<string, string> Stamps) : ISpanFormattable, IUtf8SpanFormattable {
    public static HostFingerprint Current(FrozenDictionary<string, string> stamps) =>

    public static string BandOf(long payloadBytes) =>
        Bands.Find(row => payloadBytes <= row.MaxBytes).Map(static row => row.Band).IfNone("large");

    public static ScheduleEntry Sweep(Func<IO<Unit>> work) =>
        new("compute-equivalence-sweep", new OccurrenceSpec.Every(Duration.FromDays(7)), DeadlineClass.SupportWindow, None, work);

}
```

## [6]-[TS_PROJECTION]

- Owner: `ComputeReceiptKind`, `ComputeReceiptSpineWire`, `ComputeReceiptWire`, `ComputeReceiptEnvelopeWire`, `HostFingerprintWire`, `BenchmarkClaimWire` — the receipt payload union and the claim row as the dashboard consumes them.
- Packages: BCL inbox
- Growth: a new receipt case lands as one payload row on `ComputeReceiptWire`, zero new surface.
- Boundary: payloads bind as `TPayload` through `ReceiptEnvelopeWire` with the envelope `kind` mirroring the payload discriminator; smart-enum spine fields cross as their key scalars; `Instant` and `Duration` values cross as ISO-8601 and roundtrip-pattern strings; absent evidence crosses as explicit null, never as an omitted member.

## [7]-[RESEARCH]

- [WIRE_EMISSION]: the implementation-time round-trip confirms the merged resolver chain orders `ComputeWireContext` after the Thinktecture key-scalar resolver so the polymorphic `kind` discriminator and every smart-enum spine field serialize and deserialize to the identical case, and that `Seq<string>` collection members on the `Selection` case survive the merge without a `JsonConverter` for the LanguageExt collection.
- [CALENDAR_BRIDGE]: the `Google.Type.Date`/`TimeOfDay`/`DayOfWeek` calendar wire types and the `Google.Api.CommonProtos` assembly that carries them, with the `ToDate`/`ToLocalDate`/`ToTimeOfDay`/`ToLocalTime`/`ToProtobufDayOfWeek`/`ToIsoDayOfWeek` conversion members the calendar-bridge wire-stamp columns bind.
