# [PY_COMPUTE_TASKLOG]

Open and closed work distilled from `IDEAS.md`. `[1]-[OPEN]` carries task cards whose leader holds a status marker — `[QUEUED]`, `[ACTIVE]`, or `[BLOCKED]` — and three to four scoped bullets: the capability or file to build, the external packages to integrate, the integration points and boundaries or wires, and the key considerations. `[2]-[CLOSED]` carries `[COMPLETE]` and `[DROPPED]` items. One idea spawns one or more tasks; each task names the exact sub-domain or file it lands in.

OPEN contains `ACTIVE` work and `QUEUED` next-up work in logical sequence; `BLOCKED` keeps open but non-actionable work; `CLOSED` separates finished `COMPLETE` items from unimplemented `DROPPED` items. `Ripple` names the origin or counterpart card a cross-folder entry pairs with. `Atomic` flags a minor-scope task so a later session sizes its turn correctly and does not overscope a batch of small items.

## [01]-[OPEN]

<!-- source-only: open task card template:
[ID]-[STATUS]: <ambitious concise thesis>.
- Capability: <higher-order concept, invariant, or owner capability>.
- Shape: <what the idea becomes as a system, product, owner, or feature set(s)>.
- Unlocks: <new branch, package, workflow, proof, user, or agent capability made possible>.
- Anchors: <owners, seams, packages, doctrines, or techniques that make the idea plausible>.
- Tension: <only when an unresolved constraint, boundary, bet, or dependency shapes the idea>.
- Ripple: <origin/counterpart card this entry pairs with across folders, as `pkg` `[SLUG]`; present only on a cross-folder ripple counterpart card>.
- Atomic: <present only on a minor-scope task; one short phrase naming the small unit so a later session does not overscope its turn>.
-->

[STUDY_BENCH_FOLD]-[QUEUED]: land the `Measured`-to-bench projection on `experiments/study.md`.
- Capability: one fold from `Measured` wallclock and speedup to the runtime bench contribution, subject-keyed per objective.
- Anchors: `experiments/study#STUDY`; runtime `observability/profiles#BENCH`; the `rasm.bench.*` rows.
- Tension: observability evidence only — no graduation verdict rides it; `RESULT` mode suppresses the contribution with its zero elapsed.
- Atomic: one projection fold and its card fields.

## [02]-[CLOSED]

<!-- source-only: closed task card template:
[ID]-[COMPLETE|DROPPED]: <one-line disposition>; keep closed tasks collapsed unless a second retained fact changes future routing.
