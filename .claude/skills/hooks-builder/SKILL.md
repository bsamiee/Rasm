description: >-
    Builds Claude Code and Codex hooks as one discipline — command, HTTP, MCP-tool, prompt, and
    agent handlers across the full event surface. Use when building PreToolUse validation,
    PostToolUse formatting or redaction, PermissionRequest auto-approval, SessionStart context
    injection, Stop or SubagentStop continuation, PreCompact extraction, async guardrails,
    telemetry transmitters, a Codex hooks.json or config.toml adapter, or any deterministic
    blocking and non-blocking agent control — and when porting one canonical hook body across both
    providers. Where an instruction lives — memory, rule, setting, or hook — belongs to harness-steering.

# [HOOKS_BUILDER]

A hook binds a handler — shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool call, single-turn prompt, or multi-turn agent — to a lifecycle event, filtered by a matcher and an optional `if` rule. The event decides what the automation intercepts or observes, the handler decides whether the verdict is deterministic or judged, and the control channel decides how the verdict binds: exit 2 with a stderr reason is the one blocking primitive that behaves identically on both providers, and exit-0 stdout JSON is the scalpel that rewrites input, redacts output, or injects context. Build order: pick the event, pick the handler, write the config into the provider's settings surface, then prove it with a direct stdin replay before it ships. A Python body draws its dependencies from the estate's admitted libraries assumed uv-resolvable — `msgspec` for wire admission, `anyio` for structured concurrency and subprocess, `httpx` for transport, `stamina` for retry — composing the shipped primitive at full depth rather than a hand-rolled naive reimplementation, `msgspec`-lean on the hot path and richer off it.

## [02]-[EVENT_SELECTION]

- Intercept before execution -> `PreToolUse` (block, rewrite input, or defer); permission dialogs -> `PermissionRequest`; after an auto-mode denial -> `PermissionDenied` (retry signal).
- React after completion -> `PostToolUse` (format, lint, redact output), `PostToolUseFailure` (error handling), `PostToolBatch` (after a parallel batch, before the next model call).
- Session boundaries -> `SessionStart` (context, watch paths, session title), `SessionEnd` (cleanup); one-time provisioning -> `Setup`.
- Per-prompt -> `UserPromptSubmit` (inject context or block); command expansion -> `UserPromptExpansion`; displayed text -> `MessageDisplay` (display-only rewrite).
- Completion judgment -> `Stop`/`SubagentStop` (prompt or agent handler, or a completion-token command hook).
- Teams and tasks -> `TeammateIdle` (keep working), `TaskCreated` (roll back), `TaskCompleted` (gate completion).
- Environment reactivity -> `FileChanged`, `CwdChanged`, `ConfigChange` (audit or block settings edits), `InstructionsLoaded` (observe memory loads); worktrees -> `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove`; compaction -> `PreCompact`/`PostCompact`; MCP input -> `Elicitation`/`ElicitationResult`.
- Observation only -> `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, `StopFailure` (API-error autopsy; output and exit code ignored).

Codex carries ten of these events, `Stop`/`SubagentStop` among them; the team and extra-lifecycle tiers are Claude-only. The delta and its fill are the events reference.

## [03]-[HANDLER_SELECTION]

| [INDEX] | [TYPE]     | [OWNS]                                             | [DEFAULT_TIMEOUT] |
| :-----: | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------: |
|  [01]   | `command`  | Deterministic validation, formatting, transforms   |       600s        |
|  [02]   | `http`     | POSTing event JSON to a service endpoint           |       600s        |
|  [03]   | `mcp_tool` | Calling a connected MCP server tool                |       600s        |
|  [04]   | `prompt`   | Single-turn LLM judgment, `{ok, reason}` decision  |        30s        |
|  [05]   | `agent`    | Multi-turn tool-using verification, up to 50 turns |        60s        |

`command` is the only handler both providers run and the only one that enforces hard security — an `mcp_tool` disconnect or a `prompt` model timeout degrades to a non-blocking error, so real policy rides `command`. Codex parses `prompt`/`agent`/`async` and skips them, and has no `http`/`mcp_tool` handler; a dual-provider hook is therefore a `command` hook. Prompt and agent handlers bind only to the judgment-eligible events; the eligibility roster is the config reference.

## [04]-[PROVIDER_DIVERGENCE]

Claude Code is the superset: thirty events, five handler types, `terminalSequence`, async, and a rich per-event JSON dialect. Codex is command-only, synchronous, ten events including `Stop`/`SubagentStop`, tool coverage limited to `Bash`/`apply_patch`/MCP, with `notify` a separate legacy notification channel beside the bus. The one path that behaves identically on both is exit 2 plus a stderr reason on the shared tool, prompt, and `Stop`/`SubagentStop` events — a hook body that only ever blocks that way ports verbatim with zero dialect branching. The moment a hook injects context or rewrites a value through stdout JSON, the per-event dialect diverges and the dual-provider reference owns the exact shape per provider.

## [05]-[GATE]

A built hook proves before it ships: the settings JSON parses (`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.claude/settings.json'))"`), the script is executable, and a fixture replay exercises the handler — `printf '%s' '{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"npm test"}}' | ./hook.py; echo $?` returns the intended exit code, with a malformed-payload replay proving the fail-closed path. The full verification battery, the dual-mode red-team harness, and the diagnostic surfaces are the verification reference.
