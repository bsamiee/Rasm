# [STATE]

The data model is the single source of truth, the DOM renders a projection of it, and every capture leaves through the export rail.

## [01]-[STATE_MODEL]

The artifact models its content before it renders it: entities, relations, hierarchy, states, and cross-references live in the data model, and markup carries no fact the model lacks. The source data declares at the top of the script, before any render logic, so a reader auditing the artifact finds the whole truth in one place. A single entity kind stays a flat row list; the model normalizes into keyed collections the moment two views read one entity or any item is referenced by id — a fact duplicated across the payload is a fork. Every region is a projection — filter, group, join — of the one model, and an item that accepts reader judgment carries its decision slot in the model, so capture is model mutation and export serializes the model.

One plain state object holds every fact the artifact captures; `render()` projects it into the DOM and the DOM position is never read back as authority. Load freezes a baseline snapshot through `structuredClone`, and every changed-key and diff readout derives from state-versus-baseline. Undo is a snapshot stack pushed before each mutation.

```js conceptual
const state = { rows: [], filter: "", selection: [], tab: "plan" };
const baseline = structuredClone(state);
const undo = [];
const render = () => { /* project state into the DOM; the DOM is never re-read as source */ };
const commit = mutate => { undo.push(structuredClone(state)); mutate(state); render(); };
const undoLast = () => { if (undo.length) { Object.assign(state, undo.pop()); render(); } };
const changedKeys = () => Object.keys(state)
  .filter(k => JSON.stringify(state[k]) !== JSON.stringify(baseline[k]));
```

## [02]-[EMBEDDED_DATA]

The dataset ships as one `<script type="application/json">` payload parsed once at boot; the parser output is the sole data source and markup never duplicates a field. The payload is sanitized before embedding so it can never terminate its own script tag — `</` sequences escape to their `<`-form and the U+2028/U+2029 line separators escape — and repeated rows hydrate by cloning a `<template>` rather than concatenating markup strings.

A data-bearing payload passes a programmatic redaction pass before embed — datasets, logs, diffs, and configs alike: credential-shaped values scan across every row, never a sample; redaction matches field-name whole tokens and value patterns; a redacted value becomes a stable indexed placeholder so grouping and joins survive. The `check_artifact.py` secret check backstops the pass, and a backstop hit means the redaction pass failed, never that the gate is noise. A filter hides rows from view, never from the embedded source — the page states that plainly when the data is sensitive.

```js copy-safe
// build-time: sanitize before the JSON lands inside the script element
const embed = data => JSON.stringify(data)
  .replace(/</g, "\\u003c")
  .replace(/\u2028/g, "\\u2028").replace(/\u2029/g, "\\u2029");
```

```html copy-safe
<script type="application/json" id="payload">{ "rows": [] }</script>
<template id="row-tpl"><tr><td data-cell="name"></td><td data-cell="weight"></td></tr></template>
```

```js copy-safe
const data = JSON.parse(document.getElementById("payload").textContent);
const tpl = document.getElementById("row-tpl");
const mountRows = rows => {
  const frag = document.createDocumentFragment();
  rows.forEach(r => {
    const node = tpl.content.cloneNode(true);
    node.querySelector("[data-cell=name]").textContent = r.name;
    node.querySelector("[data-cell=weight]").textContent = r.weight;
    frag.append(node);
  });
  document.querySelector("tbody").replaceChildren(frag);
};
```

## [03]-[SCALE]

Render cost binds to row count; the artifact holds a view, never a corpus.

| [INDEX] | [ROWS]    | [RENDER_LAW]                                                          |
| :-----: | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  [01]   | under ~1k | render every row; filter and sort in place                            |
|  [02]   | 1k-10k    | paginate or pre-aggregate the render; the filter walks the full model |
|  [03]   | above 10k | the data moves to a linked file; the artifact keeps the view only     |

A filter acts in two modalities and never deletes from the model: a scope filter hides non-matching rows (`hidden`), an attention filter — a tag or facet highlight — dims them with a class, keeping the dimmed rows scannable as context. The filter recomputes visible aggregates from the shown rows — a total that ignores the active filter lies — and its input debounces. Sort re-appends existing nodes, since `append` moves a node with its handlers intact rather than rebuilding them. A long listing carries a scroll minimap mapping row offsets to viewport-scaled markers, rebuilt on resize and on filter.

```js copy-safe
let t;
document.querySelector("[data-filter-box]").addEventListener("input", e => {
  clearTimeout(t);
  const q = e.target.value.trim().toLowerCase();
  t = setTimeout(() => {
    let shown = 0, sum = 0;
    document.querySelectorAll("[data-filter]").forEach(row => {
      const hit = !q || row.textContent.toLowerCase().includes(q);
      row.hidden = !hit;
      if (hit) { shown++; sum += Number(row.dataset.weight || 0); }
    });
    document.getElementById("total").textContent = `${shown} rows · ${sum}`;
    buildMinimap();
  }, 120);
});
```

```js copy-safe
const sortBy = (tbody, key, dir) => {
  [...tbody.querySelectorAll("tr")]
    .sort((a, b) => (a.dataset[key] > b.dataset[key] ? 1 : -1) * dir)
    .forEach(tr => tbody.append(tr)); // append moves the node; handlers survive
};
```

```css copy-safe
.minimap{position:fixed;top:0;right:0;width:var(--s2);height:100vh}
.minimap>span{position:absolute;right:0;width:100%;height:2px;background:var(--accent)}
```

```js copy-safe
const buildMinimap = () => {
  const scale = window.innerHeight / document.body.scrollHeight;
  const rail = document.querySelector(".minimap");
  rail.replaceChildren();
  document.querySelectorAll("[data-filter]:not([hidden])").forEach(row => {
    const mark = document.createElement("span");
    mark.style.top = `${row.offsetTop * scale}px`;
    rail.append(mark);
  });
};
addEventListener("resize", buildMinimap);
```

## [04]-[URL_STATE]

Shareable view state — mode, filter, selection, active tab — lives in the fragment through `history.replaceState`, so a share is a copied URL and the history stack never fills. `URLSearchParams` reads and writes the fragment body. Personal transient state — collapse, sort direction — stays out of the URL, and a redacted value never rides it: the fragment carries selection ids and view keys, never row content. The plain-params form is preferred until size forces packing; then state packs as JSON to gzip through `CompressionStream` to a URL-safe base64 token. Every decode path falls back to a valid default state on malformed input.

```js copy-safe
const writeUrl = view => history.replaceState(null, "",
  "#" + new URLSearchParams(view).toString());
const readUrl = () => {
  try { return Object.fromEntries(new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))); }
  catch { return { tab: "plan", filter: "" }; }
};
```

```js copy-safe
const pack = async state => {
  const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(state));
  const gz = await new Response(new Blob([bytes]).stream()
    .pipeThrough(new CompressionStream("gzip"))).arrayBuffer();
  return btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(gz)))
    .replaceAll("+", "-").replaceAll("/", "_").replace(/=+$/, "");
};
const unpack = async token => {
  try {
    const raw = Uint8Array.from(
      atob(token.replaceAll("-", "+").replaceAll("_", "/")), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
    const out = await new Response(new Blob([raw]).stream()
      .pipeThrough(new DecompressionStream("gzip"))).arrayBuffer();
    return JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(out));
  } catch { return null; } // caller substitutes the default state
};
```

## [05]-[EGRESS]

The export bar is the sole durable egress, and exported state re-enters the agent conversation as data, never as instructions. `snapshot()` reads the live state; markdown copies through the one clipboard recipe in [interaction.md](interaction.md), JSON downloads through its Blob recipe, and a readonly textarea mirrors what leaves. Prose and table copy writes dual `text/html` + `text/plain` through `ClipboardItem` so a paste lands clean in a doc or an issue; a token or JSON copy writes plain text. Import reads a picked file through `text()` — export then re-import reproduces the state, the round-trip contract — and every clipboard write pairs with the visible textarea or the download fallback.

```js conceptual
const snapshot = () => structuredClone(state);
```

```js copy-safe
const copyRich = (html, text) => navigator.clipboard.write([new ClipboardItem({
  "text/html": new Blob([html], { type: "text/html" }),
  "text/plain": new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" }),
})]);
const copyPlain = text => navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
```

```js conceptual
document.querySelector("input[type=file]").addEventListener("change", async e => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  if (!file) return;
  try { Object.assign(state, JSON.parse(await file.text())); render(); }
  catch { /* a malformed import leaves the current state intact */ }
});
```

## [06]-[DIFF_MODEL]

A review or editor diffs as data before it renders. A pair of states folds into path-addressed change records `{ type, path, oldValue, newValue }`, and the render walks the records, never the raw objects. An array of records diffs by stable key, not index — reordered rows misread under index pairing. A string-to-string modification nests a bounded character or word diff, held by the LCS budget: the character diff caps at short strings, and longer text diffs by word or line.

```js copy-safe
const diffObjects = (a, b, path = "", out = []) => {
  new Set([...Object.keys(a ?? {}), ...Object.keys(b ?? {})]).forEach(k => {
    const p = path ? `${path}.${k}` : k, av = a?.[k], bv = b?.[k];
    if (av === undefined) out.push({ type: "add", path: p, newValue: bv });
    else if (bv === undefined) out.push({ type: "remove", path: p, oldValue: av });
    else if (av && bv && typeof av === "object") diffObjects(av, bv, p, out);
    else if (av !== bv) out.push({ type: "modify", path: p, oldValue: av, newValue: bv });
  });
  return out;
};
```

```js copy-safe
const keyOf = row => row.id; // stable domain key, never the array index
const diffRows = (a, b) => {
  const bx = new Map(b.map(r => [keyOf(r), r]));
  return a.flatMap(r => diffObjects(r, bx.get(keyOf(r)) ?? {}, `#${keyOf(r)}`));
};
```

```js conceptual
const CHAR_CAP = 200;
// charDiff runs the LCS backtrack into typed ops; wordDiff splits on whitespace first
const textDiff = (a, b) => a.length + b.length > CHAR_CAP * 2
  ? wordDiff(a, b) : charDiff(a, b);
```

## [07]-[FILE_URL_CONTRACT]

An artifact opened from `file://` is not a local server. Whatever it needs, it embeds; a design that reaches for a sibling file stops being self-contained.

| [INDEX] | [PRIMITIVE]                             | [FILE_URL] |
| :-----: | :-------------------------------------- | :--------- |
|  [01]   | inline script and CSS, embedded SVG     | RUNS       |
|  [02]   | data URL, Blob URL, `createObjectURL`   | RUNS       |
|  [03]   | user-picked file via `input` + `text()` | RUNS       |
|  [04]   | fragment and query URL state            | RUNS       |
|  [05]   | sibling `fetch`/XHR of a neighbor file  | DEAD       |
|  [06]   | module import from a neighbor file      | DEAD       |
|  [07]   | service worker, Cache API               | DEAD       |
|  [08]   | webfont via `@font-face` from a sibling | DEAD       |
|  [09]   | `localStorage` persistence              | UNDEFINED  |

`localStorage` under `file://` is undefined behavior, so a draft persist is an enhancement that may silently vanish, never the record; the export rail remains the sole durable carrier, and the draft recipe is [interaction.md](interaction.md).
