# [RASM_RHINO_ARCHITECTURE]

`Rasm.Rhino` maps the Rhino 9 host boundary over the RhinoCommon surfaces, the native Eto UI sub-domain, and the `Rhino.UI` shell, composing the `Rasm` kernel for every host-neutral computation. Each sub-domain folder maps to exactly one namespace, and project references terminate at the kernel. Host owners compose same-assembly owners at their own or lower stratum. Seam map names only boundary-crossing contracts — each a frozen-name value type consumed down from the kernel — while host-internal wiring stays on the mutation spine.

## [02]-[STRATA]

Five strata order the sub-domain folders; a folder composes its own owners and lower strata only, `Rasm` kernel namespaces underlie the whole boundary as the host-neutral floor, and two ruled counter-edges stand: Document's configured-open source takes Persistence's `ArchiveMap` as its typed open-options payload, minted before any session exists, and Modeling's projection frame takes Viewport's `CameraSnapshot`/`CameraPose` value shapes — value-only, no lease or borrow crossing. Every other consumption edge points down, so a new folder seats one stratum above its highest composed owner.

- S0 `Document` — spine under everything: the `DocumentSession` demand, `Tables.Commit`, `Layers.Commit`, the transactional `DocumentStream`.
- S0 reach — every sibling composes the spine.
- S1 single-seam — spine-alone composers: `Persistence` (`ArchiveMap`, `Settings`, `AppSettings`), `Commands` (`CommandVerdict`, `PickCapture`).
- S1 single-seam — `Blocks` (`BlockGraph`, `GraphFold`), `Modeling` (`ModelGate`, `Built<TSlot>`), `Annotation` (`StyleField`, `Styles`).
- S1 single-seam — `Eto`: the `Element` realize fold and the `UiThread` floor.
- S1 law — Modeling reaches only the geometry-custody capsule and the ruled `CameraSnapshot`/`CameraPose` frame values.
- S1 law — Eto reaches only the event-detach capsule.
- S2 composite — `Objects` (`Objects`, `Attributes`, `Chronicle`) adds Commands' `PickCapture` and Blocks' `GraphFold`/`GraphProjection` evidence.
- S2 composite — `HostUi` (`HostThread`, `PanelHost`, `HostPage`) adds the whole Eto sub-domain.
- S3 `Viewport` — `ViewportLease`, `CameraPose`, `Cameras`, and `MotionPump`.
- S3 law — every borrow crosses the `HostThread` session rail, `HostThread.Run(HostWork<T>.Session(...))`, under a `SessionNeed`.
- S3 law — the capture run rail takes Modeling's `BenchEvidence`/`BenchBand` value shapes — value-only, no lease or borrow crossing.
- S4 terminal — `Display` (`Modes`, `Marks`) and `Exchange` (`Exchanges`, `Publishing`) compose Viewport's camera and capture rails.
- S4 law — Display draws through the Eto canvas and publishes conduit callback faults through Objects' `ObjectsTelemetry` egress.
- S4 `Render` — (`Registry`, `ContentStream`) borrows only the `Size2i` pixel struct; no folder composes the S4 composers.

Every kernel contract is a frozen-name value type the host binds and never re-mints — one `[BOUNDARY]` rail per consuming sub-domain, each carrying the exact member set its owner consumes. Kernel source is host-neutral and consumes nothing back, so the strata-locked dependency is source-only by construction; the kernel seam registry mirrors each edge from its producing side.

## [04]-[INTERNAL]

Every host mutation walks one path — no sub-domain opens the document directly. Document-session demand gates capability, the shared `DocumentCommit.Sealed` envelope frames the change over `UndoBracket`, the sub-domain executor runs inside it, and the sealing commit lands the typed receipt with redraw compensation; a denied demand and every mid-stage fault converge on the one rail that still releases the bracket. Exact per-stage wiring lives on the owning implementation pages.

## [05]-[NAMESPACES]

Namespace mirrors folder path — `.editorconfig` sets `dotnet_style_namespace_match_folder = true:error`, so every fence under `Rasm.Rhino/<Folder>/` declares `namespace Rasm.Rhino.<Folder>;` and the `[01]` codemap folders are the namespace roots verbatim.

Boundary compiles as ONE assembly — the single `Rasm.Rhino.csproj` — so internal members cross namespaces with no build edge, and the project references only `Rasm.csproj`. Kernel-neutral value types compose freely from the kernel, while a live host handle, a native carrier, or a `System.Drawing` screen struct never crosses out of the sub-domain that leases it.

Host-name resolution is one law: inside `Rasm.Rhino.*` a partial qualification re-resolves against the boundary's namespaces (`Rhino.UI.X` binds `Rasm.Rhino`), so fences name host members BARE — each `[RUNTIME_PRELUDE]` imports its host namespaces ahead of the file-scoped namespace declaration, resolving at global scope, and `Rasm.Rhino.csproj` carries the same rows as project-level usings. A host type the prelude cannot reach unshadowed spells `global::` in full; a host simple-name collision resolves through one csproj `<Using Alias="..." />` row, never a per-fence alias.
